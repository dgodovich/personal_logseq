- Reset graph
- Pivot for this to be a notes document for everything grad school related
	- Idea is to continue using this throughout my PhD
- I like logseq enough for it to be my main notes app
	- I do generally think in outline format so it makes sense to me
	- Github and zotero integrations are nice
		- Although I do have to improve the zotero integration at some point
	- Gradually become a power user?
		- custom templates? I don't know anything about queries
		- Spend some more time learning how to best use it
