- Things I should do today
	- Figure out if I can do a live imaging experiment tomorrow with someone turning the microscope off for me on Saturday
	- Port the density single cell code into a PyCLM compatible format
	- Try to do the same for a wave function
		- would be cool, not quite as high priority
		- But really I should do that I think
		- Ok get this done today if at all possible
	- Text Adela
	- Think about using the method that Harrison was describing yesterday in lab meeting for density evaluation
