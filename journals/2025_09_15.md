	- What am I doing today
		- Passaging both flasks and plating for imaging tomorrow
		- Splitting
			- Both flasks were split at 1:5 on Friday (3 days ago) and they now look to be at a healthy confluency level
			- Older one that the cells were thawed into should be switched out
			- Younger flask can be reused today
			- I think for now I should keep both and see that I can maintain a stable culture with my media and everything and then move back into one flask be
