	- What am I doing today
		- Passaging both flasks and plating for imaging tomorrow
		- Splitting
			- Both flasks were split at 1:5 on Friday (3 days ago) and they now look to be at a healthy confluency level
			- Older one that the cells were thawed into should be switched out
			- Younger flask can be reused today
			- I think for now I should keep both and see that I can maintain a stable culture with my media and everything and then move back into one flask be
	- Experiment
		- Plated cells at 6 different densities in 6 wells
			- Cell Counting
				- Countess told me 4.53 and 5.21 x 10^6 = average 4.87 * 10^6
				- Divide that by 2 to get 2.435 * 10^6 because there's no trypan blue
				- That's way too many cells so I added 9mL to make a 1 in 10 dilution, giving me 2.
