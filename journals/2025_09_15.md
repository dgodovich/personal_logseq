	- What am I doing today
	  collapsed:: true
		- Passaging both flasks and plating for imaging tomorrow
		- Splitting
			- Both flasks were split at 1:5 on Friday (3 days ago) and they now look to be at a healthy confluency level
			- Older one that the cells were thawed into should be switched out
			- Younger flask can be reused today
			- I think for now I should keep both and see that I can maintain a stable culture with my media and everything and then move back into one flask be
	- Experiment
		- Plated cells at 6 different densities in 6 wells
			- Cell Counting
				- Countess told me 4.53 and 5.21 x 10^6 = average 4.87 * 10^6
				- Divide that by 2 to get 2.435 * 10^6 because there's no trypan blue
				- That's way too many cells so I added 9mL to make a 1 in 10 dilution, giving me 0.2435 * 10^6 cells / mL
					- hmmmmmm I might have made 3,000 cells instead of 30,000 whoopsie
					- Yep I definitely put 3k instead of 30k
				- 10,11,12,13,15,18 \mu\L in left to right, top to bottom order
			- That equates to ~ 2.4k, 2.6k, 3k, 3.2k, 3.6k, 4.4k cells \shrug
			  collapsed:: true

	- Continue with two flasks for now
	- Thankfully I'm not doing anything critical with these yet so it's ok that there aren't that many cells
	- Next steps
		- Come in tomorrow morning before class to change media into starvation media so that cells are ready to be imaged at noon
		- Media change at ~8:30

-
- Make logseq template for 96 well plate
	- I made it but it's not quite what I want
	- It doesn't make a new draw when you use it so you still have to copy it over
	- Not ideal, revisit
