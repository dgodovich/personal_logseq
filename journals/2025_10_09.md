- Meeting with [[Danelle Devenport]]
	- very exciting meeting
	- Possibilities to work on both Brooke's and Deepika's stuff during rotation
		- shadowing the more the better tbh
	- Brooke is working on the mouse skin migration during hair follicle formation
		- exciting possibilities of taking insights from Jared's lab re FGF signaling and putting that into a developmental system
		- sorting of wnt cells is also an interesting problem
			- This seems to happen a lot of times in development
			- wnt high cells are migratory and can sort themselves into clusters
				- What's the mechanism for this? What does wnt drive? ligand or internal positive regulatory stimulation?
				- Neural crest has Wnt1 marker gene
	- Deepika is working on doing single cell
		- no sort because they want to get all of the cells
		- adult mouse skin is a bit harder to work with than embryos because it has way more ECM
			- gotta digest that shit
	- Working somewhere in the intersection of Jared, Danelle, and Kai
