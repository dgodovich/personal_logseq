- Talk with Beena again about why my cells don't have homogeneous monolayers
	- what's going on with the islands / spread out populations? Can we get them to be more homogeneous
	- something with the fibronectin?
		- change to a different coating
		- coat for longer time
		- fresh fibronectin
	- Try to a bit more systematically figure out how to change the cell properties
