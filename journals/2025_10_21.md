- Thoughts on who to rotate with
	- Kai
	- Danelle
	- Daniel
	- Jamie Link / Mo Seyedsayamdost
	- I think realistically it'll be Kai and Danelle
		- I want to continue moving more towards actual biology, not towards engineering like with Daniel
			- That said, I definitely want to continue engineering thinking in these biological contexts
	- And there really doesn't seem to be space for a more intensely chemistry focused rotation with Jamie Link
		- I'm excited for his lab meeting though, that should be fun
