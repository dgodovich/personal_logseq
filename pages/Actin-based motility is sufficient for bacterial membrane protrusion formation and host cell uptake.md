- [[Abstract]]
	- Shigella flexneri replicates in the cytoplasm of host cells, where it nucleates host cell actin filaments at one pole of the bacterial cell to form a 'comet tail' that propels the bacterium through the host's cytoplasm. To determine whether the ability to move by actin-based motility is sufficient for subsequent formation of membrane-bound protrusions and intercellular spread, we conferred the ability to nucleate actin on a heterologous bacterium, Escherichia coli. Previous work has shown that IcsA (VirG), the molecule that is necessary and sufficient for actin nucleation and actin-based motility, is distributed in a unipolar fashion on the surface of S. flexneri. Maintenance of the unipolar distribution of IcsA depends on both the S. flexneri outer membrane protease IcsP (SopA) and the structure of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the outer membrane. We co-expressed IcsA and IcsP in two strains of E. coli that differed in their LPS structures. The E. coli were engineered to invade host cells by expression of invasin from Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and to escape the phagosome by incubation in purified listeriolysin O (LLO) from Listeria monocytogenes. All E. coli strains expressing IcsA replicated in host cell cytoplasm and moved by actin-based motility. Actin-based motility alone was sufficient for the formation of membrane protrusions and uptake by recipient host cells. The presence of IcsP and an elaborate LPS structure combined to enhance the ability of E. coli to form protrusions at the same frequency as S. flexneri, quantitatively reconstituting this step in pathogen intercellular spread in a heterologous organism. The frequency of membrane protrusion formation across all strains tested correlates with the efficiency of unidirectional actin-based movement, but not with bacterial speed.

- This is like final boss of reconstituting a system in vitro, do it in vivo in a different system
- actin based motility is necessary for intercellular spread, but it's not known if the force generated is sufficient for protrusions
	- Is it that the bacteria forces its way out of the cell by actin polymerization, or does it interact with membrane proteins to do something else?
- 4 classes of mutants that can't spread
	- defects in intracellular multiplication because of a metabolic problem
	- actin polymerization mutants
	- unable to escape into cytoplasm of adjacent epithelial cell
	- 4th class is unknown reasons
- This is building on [[The making of a gradient: IcsA (VirG) polarity in Shigella flexneri]] Robbins
- lipopolysaccharide characteristics are also relevant to IcsA gradient
- membrane bound protrusions seem to be the mechanism of cell transfer
- ((68e485e0-6293-498e-af64-306db6c91109))
	- Express IcsA in E. coli and see if they can move around in a host cell
	- engineered E coli is able to infect cells which it normally can't? I think that's the part about listeriolysin O
	- number of bacteria in the host cell increases over time, and they polymerize actin
	- Figure 1 shows the E coli in the cells with actin comet tails
	- Figure 2 is a growth curve of E coli in the host cells
- They also check that unipolar distribution of IcsA matters, and it does
	- no comet tail formation without that
	- IcsP is also relevant in the same way as in the previous paper
	- having the unipolar distribution also makes the E coli move faster
- ((68e4884f-48ef-430b-9c92-c9b13c1a12bf))
	- indeed if the E. coli has IcsA it can form protrusions
	- necessary and sufficient
	- If they make it have similar properties to shigella then it behaves very similarly
	- ((68e48913-dd6f-4554-9d70-85a83300d594))
		- unidirectional movement is more important than absolute speed
- spread by extending a membrane bound protrusion into an adjacent cell
	- distend both the current cell membrane and the neighbors
	- then escape from the vacuole into the new cell cytoplasm
- they can measure the double membrane in E coli because it can't escape
	- no machinery to do that like shigella would have
