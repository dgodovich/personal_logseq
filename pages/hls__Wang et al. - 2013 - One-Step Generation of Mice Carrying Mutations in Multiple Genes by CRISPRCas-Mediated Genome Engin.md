- Because each target locus contains a restriction enzyme recognition site (Figure 1A), we PCR ampliﬁed an 500 bp fragment around each target site and digested the PCR products with the respective enzym

- Short PCR products encoding sgRNAs targeting all ﬁve genes (Tet1, Tet2, Tet3, Sry, and Uty) were pooled and cotransfected with a Cas9 expressing plasmid and the PGK puroR cassette into ES cells. Of 96 clones that were screened using the RFLP assay, 10% carried mutations in all eight alleles of the ﬁve gene
