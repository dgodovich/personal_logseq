- Simple view of recombination pathways
	- RecBCD is the main pathway of recombination in E. Coli
		- named this way for the enzyme RecBCD that act in it
		- sbcA, sbcB, sbcC suppressors
	- sbcA mutations activate the RecE pathway
		- RecE encodes exonuclease VIII
			- digests ds linear DNA in 5' -> 3' direction
		- RecE gene is part of rac phage?
		- resembles \lambda Red pathway
	- RecF pathway
		- not a great explanation for what this does?
		- bunch of helper rec_ genes required
	- RecA is important for all recombination pathways
	- ((68ccbb0e-40eb-4ea9-8948-67a0fb705042))
- Complications
	- there's at least some overlap in all pathways with recA requirement
	- recF/J/O/Q are needed for both RecE and RecF pathways, but not RecBCD
	- Plasmid recombination is different
		- might go through the RecF pathway rather than RecBCD
		- plasmid recombination proceeding by the RecE pathway does not require RecA protein
			- Also true for \lambda Red; but only in absence of phage replication
	- dsDNA ends -> RecBCD pathway; ssDNA ends -> RecF pathway
		- maybe RecF can act on DNA with nicks or without sticky ends
	- RecA seems to do synapsis of homologous DNA and exchange of strands
		- also does cleavage of DNA damaged gene repressor LexA
	- RecBCD does a bunch of stuff
		- forms ssDNA loops from dsDNA
		- cleaves at hotspot
			- makes a long ssDNA tail at 3' end
		- also has independent nuclease activity
		- Might have multiple times of operation
