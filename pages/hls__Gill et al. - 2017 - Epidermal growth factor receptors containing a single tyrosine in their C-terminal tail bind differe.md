- As shown in Fig. 7A, the isolated Grb2 SH2 domain bound well to the wild-type EGF receptor. However, it failed to bind to any of the single-Tyr EGF receptors

- However, all of the single tyrosine receptors, except the Y1045-only receptor, bound Gab1. The ability of the single-Tyr EGF receptors to bind Gab1 probably explains why these receptors were all able to activate signaling pathways such as MAP kinase and Akt

- he SH2 domain initiates the interaction of the adapter protein with the tyrosine-phosphorylated EGF receptor but that additional contacts between the tail and the Grb2 SH3 domains, or its recruited cargo protein, further stabilize the association of Grb2 with the single-Tyr EGF receptor
