- correlated with their ability to bind Gab1, identifying this as a key node in the EGF receptor signaling network

- e question arises as to whether Tyr-1148 is necessary and sufficient to support the activation of the panoply of signaling pathways that lie downstream of the EGF receptor

- These data indicate that the single tyrosine EGF receptors are expressed on the cell surface, bind EGF, and dimerize in response to ligand binding. In addition, they all retain EGF-stimulated tyrosine kinase activity

- ecause neither of these sites are known to bind Grb2 directly, it is likely that the assay is detecting Grb2 binding to Shc, which was bound to the EGF receptor and phosphorylated

- Gab1 contains a PH domain that could recruit the protein to the plasma membrane upon stimulation with EGF, thereby promoting the recruitment Gab1 to the EGF receptor

- . Similarly, removal of any single tyrosine residue did not affect the ability of Grb2, Gab1, PI3K-RI, or Shp2 to bind to the EGF recepto

- As shown in Fig. 7A, the isolated Grb2 SH2 domain bound well to the wild-type EGF receptor. However, it failed to bind to any of the single-Tyr EGF receptors

- Thus, neither the isolated SH2 domain nor the SH3 domains by themselves are able to mediate the efficient binding of Grb2 to the single-Tyr receptors
