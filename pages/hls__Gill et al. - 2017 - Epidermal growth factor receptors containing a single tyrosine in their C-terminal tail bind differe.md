- correlated with their ability to bind Gab1, identifying this as a key node in the EGF receptor signaling network

- e question arises as to whether Tyr-1148 is necessary and sufficient to support the activation of the panoply of signaling pathways that lie downstream of the EGF receptor

- These data indicate that the single tyrosine EGF receptors are expressed on the cell surface, bind EGF, and dimerize in response to ligand binding. In addition, they all retain EGF-stimulated tyrosine kinase activity

- Thus, despite the presence of just a single tyrosine residue, these receptors were remarkably catholic in their ability to engage downstream signaling molecules
