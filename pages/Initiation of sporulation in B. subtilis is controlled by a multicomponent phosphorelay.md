- [[Abstract]]
	- Stage 0 sporulation (spo0) mutants of Bacillus subtilis are defective in the signal transduction system initiating sporulation. Two of the products of these genes, Spo0A and SpoOF, are related to response regulator components of two-component regulatorysystemsused to control environmental responses in bacteria. The SpoOF response regulator was found to be the primary substrate for phosphorylation by the sporulation-specifiÂ¢ protein kinase, KinA. Phosphorylated SpoOF was the phoaphodonor for a phosphotransferase, Spo0B, which transferred the phosphate group to the second response regulator, the transcription regulatory protein Spo0A. This phosphorelay provides a mechanism for signal gathering from several protein kinases using SpoOF as a secondary messenger. These divergent signals are integrated through Spo0B phosphotransferase to activate the Spo0A transcription factor. This system provides for many levels of control to prevent capricious induction of sporulation.

- Integration of various phosphorylating signals
- Thoughts from the tommentary
	- phosphorelay is an extension of the two component regulatory system that we saw with the Omps
	- This gives you more fine tuned control over the kinetics and amplification of the signaling I guess?
	- Suppressor mutation that eliminates the need for all the other spo0 proteins is likely one that moves the equilibrium towards being phosphorylated
- ((68f45264-5f99-4718-9d24-af4eed334254))
	- Sporulating bacteria can initiate that in a small window of the cell cycle
	- Has to happen before the start of new DNA synthesis (i.e. G1)
	- Group of mutants that can't sporulate, only ever divide
		- spo0 mutants (A, B, E, F, H)
		- spo0A is the key regulatory protein
			- negative regulator of AbrB repressor
	- AbrB binds to promoter targets with cooperative binding
		- they say that this isn't a typical repressor but it sure sounds like one?
		- doesn't seem to have a DNA binding sequence, more about promoter secondary structure
	- falling AbrB levels gives release of repression, caused by higher Spo0A
	- Sof-1 is the suppressor mutant that doesn't need the other spo's
		- other genes modify Spo0A into the active form
	- N terminus is similar to OmpR N terminus
		- phosphorylation homology
	- There isn't a transmitter kinase yet
