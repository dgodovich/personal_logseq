- Introduction
	- Transcription in vitro is hard and doesn't work super well
		- particularly because it doesn't end where it's supposed to
		- starting is easy enough with the \sigma factors
	- mostly you get RNAs that are way too long
		- and they also don't release from the complex
	- looking for anything that reduces RNA synthesis? seems a bit broad, no?
		- more detailed methods for this at the end of the paper
- \rho\-factor affects Chain Propagation
	- initiation is not affected, only propagation
	- use \lambda DNA as a blueprint
	- determine total RNA synthesis by heavy hydrogen and phosphorus labelling
		- hydrogen is for total synthesis
		- phosphorus is for number of starts (initiation)
			- \gamma phosphate on GTP is labelled with 35P
	- also test with T4 and T7 phage DNA, same result
- \rho-factor produces Shorter RNA Molecules
	- synthesize various lengths of RNA and then add more to that
		- reaction mixture in the second step has all the RNA from the first one and 13C labelled nucleotides
		- so if anything is incorporated, you would see it
	- Results show that the heavy carbon containing RNAs are only in the long chains
		- i.e. only on extensions of molecules that were already present, not newly synthesized ones
	- But - importantly - there is no loss of shorter fragments, and really no change in their proportion
		- \rho doesn't have any endonuclease activity
	- Figure 2
- \rho-factor releases RNA Molecules
	- causes release from the polymerase complex
	- most RNA in in vitro experiments is normally found complexed to the DNA and RNA pol
		- sediments at the same speed
	- Adding \rho you get sedimentation at different times and the RNA is way behind the DNA
	- Figure 3
- RNA Product consists of Discrete Sizes
	- showing that it's specific stopping locations, not just random
	- expect N gene to be transcribed at all times right
		- because you need N to make all the other proteins after it
	- and immunity region until like around O
		- because going past that also requires N
		- the map in figure 4 has it up to x
	- ((68d09712-79f2-4439-b43b-ef6620c5509e))
		- so from P_left to N
		- and from P_right to cY?
		- maybe something from the immunity region?
	- do hybridization to figure out which part of the genome it comes from
		- this is done with separated strands of \lambda strains with immunity region mutations / deletions
		- so that you can see which side it comes from (which promoter)
		- so you know that it's coming from the promoter on, and which strand it aligns with
	- It lines up as expected with around N and with around immunity region
- 12S and 7S RNA Initiated at Known \lambda Promoters
	- we have promoter mutants, so lets see if those have any effects on the amount of RNA that we get
	- Yeah that's exactly what he does
	- sex mutation is a P_left mutation that basically completely turns it off (including N)
	- sex mutants do not make any 12S RNA
		- that's the one that was mapping to the left promoter near N
	- 7S RNA is removed when you use the x13 mutant from [[Regulation of repressor expression in lambda]]
	- this is a long section but it's very similar to the other ones
- More Accurate RNA synthesis with \rho-factor
	- \lambda\c17 mutant
		- c17 is a mutation that allows \lambda\cI to plate on a \lambda lysogen. It creates a new promoter allowing constitutive expression of the replication genes O and P. In multi-copy \lambda DNA titrates the repressor produced by the prophage, thus preventing lysogeny
		- doesn't need N
	- Makes more RNA than wild type region in vitro, and way more in vivo
	- I don't really get what they're doing here
	- Yeah I'm not sure and I'm moving on
- Conclusions and Discussion
	- this is where he suggests that N is an antitermination protein
	- he suggests that N is a DNA binding protein, but that seems unlikely to me
		- I guess with the thinking that \rho is a DNA binding protein that makes sense
		- but it's probably more likely to bind to the ribosome or RNA right?
	- this discussion has a lot of pretty nice predictions
	- then he gives the purification protocol and my eyes glaze over
