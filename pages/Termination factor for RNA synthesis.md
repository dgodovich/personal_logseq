- pdf is not highlightable and looks really bad in logseq for some reason, so use zotero
- Introduction
	- Transcription in vitro is hard and doesn't work super well
		- particularly because it doesn't end where it's supposed to
		- starting is easy enough with the \sigma factors
	- mostly you get RNAs that are way too long
		- and they also don't release from the complex
	- looking for anything that reduces RNA synthesis? seems a bit broad, no?
		- more detailed methods for this at the end of the paper
- \rho\-factor affects Chain Propagation
