- Introduction
	- Transcription in vitro is hard and doesn't work super well
		- particularly because it doesn't end where it's supposed to
		- starting is easy enough with the \sigma factors
	- mostly you get RNAs that are way too long
		- and they also don't release from the complex
	- looking for anything that reduces RNA synthesis? seems a bit broad, no?
		- more detailed methods for this at the end of the paper
- \rho\-factor affects Chain Propagation
	- initiation is not affected, only propagation
	- use \lambda DNA as a blueprint
	- determine total RNA synthesis by heavy hydrogen and phosphorus labelling
		- hydrogen is for total synthesis
		- phosphorus is for number of starts (initiation)
			- \gamma phosphate on GTP is labelled with 35P
	- also test with T4 and T7 phage DNA, same result
- \rho-factor produces Shorter RNA Molecules
	- synthesize various lengths of RNA and then add more to that
		- reaction mixture in the second step has all the RNA from the first one and 13C labelled nucleotides
		- so if anything is incorporated, you would see it
	- Results show that the heavy carbon containing RNAs are only in the long chains
		- i.e. only on extensions of molecules that were already present, not newly synthesized ones
	- But - importantly - there is no loss of shorter fragments, and really no change in their proportion
		- \rho doesn't have any endonuclease activity
	- Figure 2
- \rho-factor releases RNA Molecules
	- causes release from the polymerase complex
	- most RNA in in vitro experiments is normally found complexed to the DNA and RNA pol
		- sediments at the same speed
	- Adding \rho you get sedimentation at different times and the RNA is way behind the DNA
	- Figure 3
- RNA Product consists of Discrete Sizes
	- showing that it's specific stopping locations, not just random
	- expect N gene to be transcribed at all times right
		- because you need N to make all the other proteins after it
