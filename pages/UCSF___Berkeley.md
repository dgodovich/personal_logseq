- Program Information:
	- I'm doing the joint bioengineering program with UC Berkeley and UCSF, that has the most faculty that I'm interested in
	- Graduate only which is a downside for teaching, but maybe you can TA early grad courses later on
		- Berkeley fixes that problem
	- Can only apply to one (1) UCSF graduate program per year
		- So can't do dev bio and bioengineering
		- I'm doing bioeng
	- [Main website](https://graduate.ucsf.edu/)
		- [dev bio](https://dscb.ucsf.edu/)
		- [dev bio admissions page](https://dscb.ucsf.edu/admissions)
	- [Stats](https://graduate.ucsf.edu/admission/graduate-program-statistics/phd-program-statistics)
		- [dev bio specific tables](https://graduate.ucsf.edu/admission/graduate-program-statistics/phd-program-statistics/program-stats-dscb)
		- This is probably the most selective program I'm applying to, it's 10% or less acceptance rate
- Faculty:
	- scraped csv of faculty members for UCSF dev bio, not super relevant anymore
	- [BioE Tissue engineering faculty](https://bioegrad.berkeley.edu/faculty/faculty-by-research-area?tx_subject_area=tissue)
