- Program Information:
	- I'm doing the joint bioengineering program with UC Berkeley and UCSF, that has the most faculty that I'm interested in
	- Graduate only which is a downside for teaching, but maybe you can TA early grad courses later on
		- Berkeley fixes that problem
	- Can only apply to one (1) UCSF graduate program per year
		- So can't do dev bio and bioengineering
		- I'm doing bioeng

		- This is probably the most selective program I'm applying to, it's 10% or less acceptance rate
