- Hanukkah menorah
	- made on breadboard
- Advent of Code
	- I didn't do it daily but I would still like to do all the challenges at some point
- Profile picture generator
	- My google (and steam and maybe some other stuff) profile picture is some green waveform image I got from somewhere like 10 years ago
	- It's not mine though and I have no idea who or what to credit for it
	- I don't think that's a huge deal as it's very generic (and could even be a stock image), but it would be cool to recreate something similar so I don't have to worry about that
	- Ideas:
		- Waveform plotter in python
		- Use desmos to get something close to what I want?
		- Photoshop or illustrator? I have it on my mac until I leave MSK
- Train map
	- I'd really like to do this before I leave the city, but maybe doing it after would also be fun
	- At least get a prototype working
	- ESP32 has wifi connectivity so I think that's the way to do it
- Fencing test box
	- ESP32 based
	- I'd like to replicate the A6 box
