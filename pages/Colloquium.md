	- [[Beena]] from [[Jared Toettcher]]
		- engineering synthetic RTKs to tune signaling responses
		- AAs next to the RTK active tyrosine site define specificity
		- PDGF is used in topical healing to promote migration into the wound site
		- phosphotyrosine motif makes a big difference on what happens when you start signaling
		- PI3K binding motifs promote migration
		- STAT5 motifs break PI3K migration with a positional effect
			- not yet super clear how this works
			- potentially something with steric hindrance of PI3K getting to the tyrosine
			- competitive binding?
			- why do multiple motifs cause stronger reactions up to a certain point?
		- Maybe this can be related to [[504 Minigrant]]?
