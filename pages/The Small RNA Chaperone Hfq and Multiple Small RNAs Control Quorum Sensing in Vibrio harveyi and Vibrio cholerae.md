- Quorum sensing
- ((68f57f25-2a70-4684-b345-6dce04043582))
	- Quorum sensing is a process of cell to cell communication for bacterial population sensing
		- based on autoinducers - extracellular small molecules
	- some are used for interspecies communication, others for intra
	- V. harveyi has two autoinducers that do different things
		- turn on bioluminescence, siderophores, colonies, metalloproteases
	- sythetases: LuxM -> AI1; LuxS -> AI2
	- LuxN detects AI1; LuxPQ detects AI2
		- N and Q are sensor kinase proteins in a two component system
		- P binds AI2 in the periplasm, required with Q for response
	- phosporelay LuxU is in the middle
	- LuxU transmits to response regulator LuxO
	- There's also a transcriptional activator LuxR that's needed for transcription of all of the lux sensing genes
	- That whole paragraph is very detail heavy; Figure 1 summarizes
	- Cholera has very similar quorum sensing
		- but it has a third system that also goes through LuxO
		- HapR is the LuxR homolog
		- important for virulence and biofilm formation
	- Low cell density (low autoinducer) you get kinase activity and do LuxU to LuxO transfer (LuxO-P accumulation)
	- High cell density (high autoinducer) sensors act as phosphatases so you get LuxU-P accumulation, and then LuxR activation at the lux promoter
	- Paper is about how this regulation towards LuxR happens
		- they're showing small RNAs
		- idea is that it's an indirect effect, and repressors don't need a weird \sigma
- ((68f5824c-dce8-4534-9dc3-f8bb3e1ceb93))
	- use a mutant that is perma activated and always in LuxO-P state (appearance wise)
		- LuxO-P is a transcriptional activator for the repressor of lux
		- cells look dark even in groups (no bioluminescence)
	- Use transposon insertion mutagenesis and select for bright colonies
		- most of the mutants were in luxO or rpoN (\sigma54) which is not what they want
	- Use a phage plasmid library (cosmid) to search for complementation to do the genomic mapping
		- single locus
	- hfq gene
- ((68f58264-c742-4d13-8522-30fe0f417ef3))
	- null mutations were used to identify what it does
	- Hfq null is constitutively bright
		- required for repression of lux expression
	- Same is true in cholera, orthogonal species
		- they also show that this effect is relevant for virulence, not just brightness
- ((68f58278-305c-41ed-8b70-95b0676532c8))
	- Hfq binds a variety of sRNAs and varies the stability of target mRNA
		- So, regulation of quorum sensing repression is post-translational, and involves one or more sRNAs
	- Take a look at LuxR/HapR (master regulators of regulons)
		- Hfq could directly act on the target genes of these regulators
		- Or, it could act on the mRNA of the regulator (which makes more sense to me)
	- Hfq lowers the stability of the luxR and hapR mRNA
		- null has slower degradation
		- Figure 3
		- this is specific to these RNAs, does not affect degradation speed of general RNA
	- I don't really understand the experiment to
