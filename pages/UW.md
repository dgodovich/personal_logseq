- Program Information:
	- Genome Sciences has most of the interesting people, but they have other departments
		- [department link](https://www.gs.washington.edu/index.htm)
	- Molecular and Cell bio is the other department I would consider applying to (could do both ig)
		- [department link](https://mcb-seattle.edu/)
		- I think it's better to do MCB - a lot of the genome bio people I am interested in are crosslisted, and the same is true for bioengineering
		- Would rather not do both even if there's a lot of overlap. Better to actually pick the correct program and save time and money
	- [Institute for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine](https://iscrm.uw.edu/)
