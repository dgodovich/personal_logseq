- In summary, conjugational recombinatian follows the RecBCD patfiway in wild-type E. coli, the RecE pathway in recBC sbcA mutants, and the RecF pathlway in recf3C sbcBC mutants.â€˜RecA protein is required for conjugational recombination by all of these pathways;

- here is overlap between the pathways, as exemplified by the requirernent for RecA protein in all three pathways.
