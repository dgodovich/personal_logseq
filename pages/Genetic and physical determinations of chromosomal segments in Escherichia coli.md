- Notes below
- Conjugation - oriented transfer of DNA from donor to recipient bacteria
	- Oriented in the sense that there is an order of the transferring, and a rate
- The Genetic system of E. Coli K-12
	- Genetic recombination may be seen between different strains of E. Coli
	- You can plate on selective media (agars) to select of recombinants
	- Recipient bacteria referred to by F-
	  background-color:: green
		- they're all the same
	- Two main types of donors
		- Most are F+
			- When mixed with F- cells they have a low frequency (10^-5)
		- Some strains have a high frequency of recombination and are called Hfr
			- but this is actually only for certain parts of their genome
			- Up to 1/10
		- this high freq allows you to analyze conjugation at the cell level
	- Steps of conjugation

		  1. Establishment of an effective contact between cells of opposite mating types
			- This is pretty fast, all possible matings occus within 30 min
			- There's a bridge between the bacteria (sex pilus?)
		- 2. Oriented transfer of chromosomal segment of the Hfr donor
