- [[Abstract]]
	- We previously obtained strains of Escherichia coli in which the beginning of gene lacZ, which codes for P-galactosidase, is replaced by the beginning of gene lamB, which codes for a maltose-inducible outer membrane protein. In some of these strains the induction (with maltose) of lamB-lacZ hybrid protein synthesis was lethal because of membrane damage resulting from an incomplete export of this protein to the outer membrane. We describe here a class of maltose-resistant mutants obtained from one such strain. Mutants in this class fail to produce the lamB-lacZ hybrid protein but retain the ability to express lacY, which is located distal to the hybrid gene. Some of the mutants carry deletions within the hybrid gene. The others carry point mutations which most probably affect the initiation of translation at the beginning ofthe hybrid gene. One ofthese is located in the sequence that codes for the presumed ribosome interaction site on the mRNA. Three others, ofwhich two are located in the coding region (sixth codon), are believed to result in an alteration of mRNA secondary structure such that the accessibility of the ribosome interaction site is reduced.

- bomb the lamB-lacZ fusion with a ton of maltose to select for Mal+/MalR strains
	- these are normally Mal sensitive because induction of maltose clogs transport machinery with lacZ and then the cells die
	- Most of the mutants that they find are also Lac-
		- this means that they lost the whole thing or the lacZ component
	- Additional selection for Melibiose+
		- these ones have functioning lacY
		- Mel is a non-inducing substrate I think?
- Looking for Mal+ Lac- Mel+
	- these ones don't make lacZ protein
	- but they do make lacY, and it's inducible
	- find 26 of them
- Mutants can be in either LacZ or in lamB
	- 17 LacZ mutants found by failure of recombination with F'lac strains
		- also check if these deletions extend into lamB, some do
			- do this with a Dex+ phenotype
		- 6 don't recombine with lamB, probably in signal sequence
		- 11 recombine with lamB
			- these ones remove all of lacZ
		- ((68fb8402-4e79-421e-a511-7725f7bbfc95))
	- 9 recombine with F'lac, so they have lamB mutations
		- these guys get some weird stuff when they recombine with lamB deletions
		- reduction in protein
		- ((68fb8392-9e3f-4f59-a273-6098fdb0285f))
- map the lamB mutant and find that they're close to the beginning
	- DNA sequence mapping finds that two mutations are in the signal sequence and 2 are in translation initiation region
