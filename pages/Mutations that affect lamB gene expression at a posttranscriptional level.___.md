- [[Abstract]]
	- We previously obtained strains of Escherichia coli in which the beginning of gene lacZ, which codes for P-galactosidase, is replaced by the beginning of gene lamB, which codes for a maltose-inducible outer membrane protein. In some of these strains the induction (with maltose) of lamB-lacZ hybrid protein synthesis was lethal because of membrane damage resulting from an incomplete export of this protein to the outer membrane. We describe here a class of maltose-resistant mutants obtained from one such strain. Mutants in this class fail to produce the lamB-lacZ hybrid protein but retain the ability to express lacY, which is located distal to the hybrid gene. Some of the mutants carry deletions within the hybrid gene. The others carry point mutations which most probably affect the initiation of translation at the beginning ofthe hybrid gene. One ofthese is located in the sequence that codes for the presumed ribosome interaction site on the mRNA. Three others, ofwhich two are located in the coding region (sixth codon), are believed to result in an alteration of mRNA secondary structure such that the accessibility of the ribosome interaction site is reduced.
