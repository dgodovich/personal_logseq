- [[Abstract]]
	- Using a genetic selection for mutations which allow large maltodextrins to cross the outer membrane of Escherichia coli in the absence of the LamB maltoporin, we have obtained and characterized two mutations that define a new locus of E. coli. We have designated this locus imp for increased membrane permeability. Mapping studies show that the imp gene resides at approximately 1.2 min on the E. coli chromosome. The mutations alter the permeability of the outer membrane resulting in increased sensitivity to detergents, antibiotics and dyes. The mutations are non reverting and codominant. Genetic analysis of the mutations suggest that the imp gene is an essential gene. We describe a general cloning strategy that can be used to clone both dominant and recessive alleles. Using this technique, we have cloned the wild-type and mutant imp alleles onto a low copy number plasmid.

- lipopolysaccharide is important component of OM
- Permeability is impacted by a bunch of factors
	- mutations
		- LPS structure, lipid biosynthesis, porin structure
		- and a bunch of unknown mechanism ones
	- EDTA
	- local anesthetics
	- inhibitors of LPS biosynthesis
- Start with lamB- strain and select for Dex+
	- these strains must be porous enough to let in maltodextrins
- ((68fe6e5a-5a84-4343-932d-7c7accc6bc65))
	- transposon mutagenesis
	- kasugamycin is an antibiotic I guess
- ((68fe75a1-c54b-4628-950e-ddf4c7a6599e))
	- most mutants that they get in their lamB- Dex+ selection are OmpF/C mutants
	- They find two very rare mutants 4213 and 208
	- these are in imp
- ((68fe7613-0dfa-4804-97d9-908d4e84c66d))
	- transfer imp mutations with P1 generalized transduction into a strain using a linked Tn10
	- Linked to known Tn10 markers? not sure what this means
	- pleiotropic gene
		- antibiotic sensitivity, detergent sensitivity, Dex+
	- 100 fold change in permeability of large molecules
	- No change in phage sensitivity
	- They do a bunch of genetic mapping
- Diploid analysis to see if it's dominant
	- imp+ on the plasmid
	- Dex+ and MacConkey agar sensitive phenotype is recessive
	- Nov sensitive and Em sensitive is dominant
	- mutant is lost in recombination, wt preferred
	- Look for revertants by selecting for detergent and/or drug resistance
		- they only get pseudorevertants
		- is that a suppressor?
- imp gene is essential
	- selection drives deletion of mutant imp -> essential?
	- imp phenotype - NovobiocinS Erythromycin (Em)S MacConkey Agar S Dex+
- Use strains lacking porins to show that it's not because of a change in porin structure
- Ran gels to look for protein difference in OM, none found
