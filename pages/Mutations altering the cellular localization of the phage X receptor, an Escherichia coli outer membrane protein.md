- [[Abstract]]
	- Two mutant strains of Escherichia coli have been isolated in which the cellular location of an outer membrane protein, the phage X receptor (the lamB gene product), is altered. These mutations were initially selected in a strain containing a lamB-lacZ fusion. In the parent strain the protein coded for by the hybrid gene is located, at least in part, in the outer membrane. In the mutants it is located in the cytoplasm. The mutations responsible for the alteration of cellular location lie very early in the lamB gene, in a region corresponding to the NH2-terminus of the X receptor protein. One of these mutations is a small deletion internal to the lamB gene., When this mutation is present in an otherwise wild-type lamB gene, the protein produced is of lower molecular weight than normal receptor.. The other mutation behaves as a point mutation; when it is present in an otherwise normal lamB gene, reversion can be demonstrated. The molecular weight of this mutant protein, which is located in the cytoplasm, is larger than that of the wild-type gene product by approximately 2000. It is suggested that these two mutations *re in the portion of the lamB gene coding for a signal sequence and thereby block export of the protein.

- Genetics for protein localization is pretty crazy to me but they're doing it
- signal sequence at the N terminus of proteins
	- this binds the new peptide to the ER and then is cut off
	- protein is translated into the ER, i.e. opposite side of membrane
- They use lacZ fusions to study this (in classic Tom fashion)
	- N terminus is from lamB gene, so it should be able to be localized

	- radiolabeling of amino acids with C14
	- these are translational fusions
	- wow there's like no methods

	- pop3186 has maltose induced expression of lamB-lacZ fusion
		- this is the normal way \lambda receptor synthesis is induced
