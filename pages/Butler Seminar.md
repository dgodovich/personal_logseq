	- TEs are essential component of the genome - Barbara McClintock
	- Mutagenic activity of transposition
		- tons of insertions used in labs are from TE
	- Genomes are full of "junk" TE
		- unable to mobilize anymore for various reasons
		- 1/2 the human genome is TE, 85% of maize is TE
	- 99.99% of human TE are transpositionally dead
		- Of 5 million TE, only about 1000 are active in transposition
	- Can measure age of sequence by measuring degree of difference from consensus sequence
		- the more mutations the further away you are, and therefore the older
	- Junk, not trash
		- just sitting there waiting for the potential to be used
	- many cis regulatory elements map to TE
	- And around 200 protein coding genes are derived from TE
		- can identify based on transposase and Gag domains
	- Gag encoded by retroviruses and retrotransposons
		- protect viral DNA
		- make capsid, and can still assemble into viral like particles (e.g. Arc, PNMA2)
		- about 50 Gag genes in human
		- Might be a form of RNA based intercellular communication?
	- Zebrafish is a tractable system that has mor recently active TE
	- What if selfish TE has a gradient towards coopted TE?
	- developing embryo has expressed TE element in lineage specific manner
		- Bik is a mesoendoderm marker in zebrafish and is an LTR transposon
			- can't move by itself, needs an additional master element
		- Crestin is also a TE, marker for neural crest
		- Effects on cell migration
		- ERNI in chicken, also a neural crest marker and a Gag TE
			- regulated by piwi, which is normally functional in germ cells
