-
- 1) How does the RNAi screen performed here differ conceptually from the screen in the Kamath paper?
- 2) How does the strategy for delivery of the RNAi differ from the strategy in the Kamath paper and what are the relative advantages and disadvantages?
- 3) How saturating is the screen? How do they try to estimate?
- 4) If you identify several hundred genes in an RNAi screen, how might you determine whether they are really involved in the pathway you are studying (in this case Notch signaling)? What do they do?
