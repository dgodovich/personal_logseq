- My first thought is I don't have time for this but that's exactly the problem, I'm just avoiding it
- And anyway I'm not even working on the other things that I'm supposed to be working on so it doesn't matter
	- I guess I was thinking about it a little
- I do want to be friends with Sakshee
	- I feel like I don't know how to support her though
	- And now I almost feel like I can't and it's just a drain
		- Like I have all this other stress that I don't talk to her about at all
		- I know that she probably would say I should just talk to her but that's a different problem
	- I just avoided thinking about this for another few minutes
- Do I bring up the thing izzy said about her maybe having feelings for me?
	- I don't want to talk about that either
	- and if I directly bring that up like that she'll definitely say no and also put it together that it's izzy who said that
		- which is not great bc then she'll spiral more
	- I just don't know how to deal with it
		- how do I avoid her spiraling
- What I said in the past about me just kinda pausing many friendships recently is true, but she's much more sensitive to that
	- But not only that it is that I am avoiding talking to her because I don't know what to say like ever
	- I don't know
	-

- I feel like I don't talk about how I feel with anyone
	- Izzy more than anyone else but that's still not enough
