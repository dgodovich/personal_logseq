- My first thought is I don't have time for this but that's exactly the problem, I'm just avoiding it
- And anyway I'm not even working on the other things that I'm supposed to be working on so it doesn't matter
	- I guess I was thinking about it a little
- I do want to be friends with Sakshee
	- I feel like I don't know how to support her though
	- And now I almost feel like I can't and it's just a drain
		- Like I have all this other stress that I don't talk to her about at all
		- I know that she probably would say I should just talk to her but that's a different problem
	- I just avoided thinking about this for another few minutes
- Do I bring up the thing izzy said about her maybe having feelings for me?
	- I don't want to talk about that either
	- and if I directly bring that up like that she'll definitely say no and also put it together that it's izzy who said that
		- which is not great bc then she'll spiral more
	- I just don't know how to deal with it
		- how do I avoid her spiraling
- What I said in the past about me just kinda pausing many friendships recently is true, but she's much more sensitive to that
	- But not only that it is that I am avoiding talking to her because I don't know what to say like ever
	- I don't know

- There's a lot of things I admire about you and even more that I respect. You're phenomenally smart and you have a kind of crazy work ethic, and you care so deeply about the people in your life. You always so honestly want to be there for them and support and devote time and energy and all these other wonderful things. But I feel like you don't do that to yourself. Recently I have been feeling like I almost don't know how to be your friend anymore, and although that's certainly partly due to my sudden lack of any work life balance, I think part of it is also that it is difficult to know what to say to you. I do not have that seemingly limitless energy and love for my friends, and that again is something I really admire about you. That's not to say that I do not want to spend time with you or that I do not have love for you, but it's more that recently it's felt difficult. I think when we had fairly consistent weekly / biweekly hanging out, it was easy to keep it going and to have a shared space and language. But over the summer as you were at home and struggling with your mental health, and as I have become increasingly unavailable timewise, it's slowly progressed to the point that I don't know what to say. I still value your input and want the best for you and want to be there while you go through this new job, re-adjust to being in the city, continue navigating your grief, and all of the other things that we have talked about, but somehow it feels more distant now.
- It's kind of a catch 22 because as I feel more distant I think you need support more and that really only has the opposite effect. I guess at some point it started to feel like a burden. Man that sucks to say. I don't want you to be a burden. It also feels really unfair because losing your dad is a huge part of that and what am I supposed to do there like you're so completely justified in feeling like shit for just about as long as you need; but at the same time I don't know what to do.
- I think another thing that contributed to this was that quite honestly I did not like your friends. I don't think I will say this part to you directly because that is quite mean. In Bangkok, I didn't understand the friendship dynamics going on between anyone, really. Nick and Mac are weirdos and I know they're not your friends directly, but I didn't understand how Anjali fit in there. I also wasn't really a fan of my interactions with Anjali, I just got kinda bad vibes. I liked Ashna more. And there's the whole thing with the location and all that weirdness

- I feel like I don't talk about how I feel with anyone
	- Izzy more than anyone else but that's still not enough
