- Notes below
- Abstract
	- arabinose mutants
	- 3 and 4 factor transduction experiments with phage P1bt
	- thr and leu located on either side of the arabinose cluster
	- abortive transduction tests
	- assayed with complementation
	- I didn't really understand that but lets get into it
- Introduction
	- auxotrophic salmonella mutants for tryptophan and histidine can be divided into groups based on blocks in biosynthesis
		- Does he mean literal block like they can't do this or block like genomic chunks
	- Mutants in different groups were linked in transduction experiments
		- I don't know what that means either
	- Grouping of mutant sites on the chromosome corresponds closely to grouping by functional criteria
		- Sooo like operons? lac z y a all close together
	- "Order of groups on the chromosome was the same as that of the sequence of biochemical reactions which they controlled"
		- so yes like operons
	- Most mutant site orders haven't been determined
	- You can jointly transduce genes that are close to each other
		- In this case thr leu and ara markers can be done together (ara in the middle)
	- So they go about using that joint transduction strategy to locate 17 arabinose mutants
- Materials and Methods
	- Will skim this
	- Media has either arabinose or glucose as sugar, and w/ & w/o threonine and leucine
	- *Escherichia coli* B/r, threonine requiring mutant, leucine requiring mutant (auxotroph)
	- *thr leu* strain was the basis for all arabinose mutants
		- *thr* mutant irradiated and *ara* mutant isolated
		- Phage was grown on the *leu* mutant and transduced the *thr ara* strain
		- selected for *ara*+ transductants
		- One clone that was auxotrophic for leu, thr, and ara was the parent
	- These are mutants that can't use arabinose
	- They also make a complementary strain that is *thr+ ara leu+*
- Results
	- Position of ara Mutants in Relation to thr and leu
		- ara-2 and ara-3 are on opposite ends of the arabinose region
		- But generally arabinose is close to leu and far from thr
			- estimated by frequencies of joint transduction
		- Order is *thr ara leu* and not *thr leu ara* is
			- 6% of thr+ transductants are ara+, 4% are leu+
			- 80% of thr+ leu+ transductants are ara+, 55.4% leu+ are ara+
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1757035211157_0.png)
			- ara-2 is further away, lower percent cotransduction with leu+
	- Recombination between ara mutants
		- nonidentical ara mutants are crossed. Recipient is auxotrophic for both, donor is + for both thr and leu
			- select for thr leu ara triple + (on separate plates)
			- thr+ and leu+ are similar numbers to wt donor, but ara+ is lower
		- Estimate the distance between two ara sites by ratio of ara+ to leu+ transductants in the same experiment
			- Looking for complementation?
			- Ratio is ~70% with any ara mutant and wt donor and varies for the various ara mutants
	- Order of ara sites
		- Reciprocal crosses with pairs of ara mutants
		- In each case the recipient is auxotrophic for thr and leu and the donor is thr+ leu+
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1757037132295_0.png)
		- Crossing over has to happen multiple times and that results in combinations of phenotypes that can give you information about chromosomal positioning
			- Frequency of phenotypes matters because quadruple crossovers are rarer than double
		- Select for ara+ and score for leu+ and thr+
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1757037695070_0.png)
			- Basically - when the recipient has a higher percentage with leu+ than the reciprocal, it's closer to leu+
		- thr is kinda far away so all the numbers are low, they stop using it

		- No need to do every cross since you can do placements, like a logic puzzle
		- Use 1 2 3 as landmarks to place the other 14 mutants
			- 21 and 19 are the same

				- final layout
	- Negative Interference
		- non adjacent mutations have larger differences?
		- Proportion of leu+ transductants in the high member decreases and the low increases
		- So I think negative interference means that there's more crossing over events so what that means is that the quadruple cross over that's required is more likely to happen
	- Division of the 17 mutants into A B C groups on the basis of physiological differences
		- arabinose metabolism requires a ketose intermediate (ribulose)
		- Group A mutants are inhibited by arabinose and have trace keto sugar (ara 2, 13, 17, 4)
		- Group B mutants are inhibited, but have large amounts of keto sugar (1, 16,6,23,14,15,24,8)
			- All of them accumulate L ribulose
		- Group C mutants is resistant to arabinose and has small amounts of keto sugar (3, 12,5,19/21)
	- Identification of Group C mutants by Abortive Transduction
		- minute colonies are present in group C but not in A or B when used with wt donor
		- Do not make minute colonies when transduced by phage from group C mutants
		- Ratio with wt is 6:1, phage from A or B ratio decreases with distance
			- i.e. ara-1 donor is 250:1, ara-2 donor is 50:1
		- Something to do with group C being resistant to arabinose?
		- Abortive transduction is when the DNA is not incorporated into the genome
