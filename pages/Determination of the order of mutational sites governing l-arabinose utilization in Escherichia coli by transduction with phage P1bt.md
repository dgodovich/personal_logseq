- Notes below
- Abstract
	- arabinose mutants
	- 3 and 4 factor transduction experiments with phage P1bt
	- thr and leu located on either side of the arabinose cluster
	- abortive transduction tests
	- assayed with complementation
	- I didn't really understand that but lets get into it
- Introduction
	- auxotrophic salmonella mutants for tryptophan and histidine can be divided into groups based on blocks in biosynthesis
		- Does he mean literal block like they can't do this or block like genomic chunks
	- Mutants in different groups were linked in transduction experiments
		- I don't know what that means either
	- Grouping of mutant sites on the chromosome corresponds closely to grouping by functional criteria
		- Sooo like operons? lac z y a all close together
	- "Order of groups on the chromosome was the same as that of the sequence of biochemical reactions which they controlled"
		- so yes like operons
	- Most mutant site orders haven't been determined
	- You can jointly transduce genes that are close to each other
		- In this case thr leu and ara markers can be done together (ara in the middle)
	- So they go about using that joint transduction strategy to locate 17 arabinose mutants
- Materials and Methods
	- Will skim this
	- Media has either arabinose or glucose as sugar, and w/ & w/o threonine and leucine
