- Thoughts:
- I am excited about Duke, I think it will be a great place for me to study and do my phd. Durham is a nice enough town with some things to do and reportedly very nice people. I am worried about the car ownership and reliance on driving aspect, but that won't be that different anywhere else. There's a chill vibe overall that I really liked
- Princeton would definitely be harder. Juxtaposed to Duke's chill vibe, Princeton definitely has rigorous individual labs and a lot more pressure to be high acheiving, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. The QE seems harder (people fail), the first year workload seems harder, it's maybe more focused. But it's also close to what I know and close to home and close to Izzy. In many ways the life adjustment would be a lot easier. But that's only a concern for right now - that doesn't really effect the rest of the 6 years there

- Here's what it comes down to
	- I was just thinking about why I haven't sent a letter of continued interest to Princeton, and why I don't really feel that I want to. I think part of that is that I truly am happy with Duke and I do not want to change it for the various reasons (disappointing others, leaving cohort, hassle, etc., none of which are particularly valid), but there is a larger and more meaningful component. I believe that if Princeton gave me an offer I would take it, but I do not want to actively fight for the offer. Princeton seems to be the better choice for my career development, networking opportunities, campus access, and general professional growth. It is also better for location and Izzy, which is important. But Duke is where I think I would be more successful and happier. That "chill vibe" feeling that I got there from a lot of the faculty and program staff and students feels much more in line with what I need to succeed as a student and scientist. Princeton would be fun, I have no doubt about that, but it would not be the same. The level of pressure and expectations from day one would be higher, and although I believe I would be able to step up to that and achieve great things there, the environment at Duke is a better fit for me. There's also the component of Duke being further away - this is both good and bad, as I get the outside of New York experience that I wanted, but I have to struggle with Izzy. That's something I will have to navigate as I get there, I can't predict what future me will feel or want to do.
	- All that is to say
		- If Princeton gives me an offer from the waitlist tomorrow or Monday, I will accept.
		- But I am happy if they do not
