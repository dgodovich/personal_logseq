		- What drives cancer metastasis? How do cancer cells modulate their fitness?
		- Metastatic niches
			- Something has to happen around the location of cancer leaving to organize it
		- Bone is the most common metastatic site in breast cancer
			- cancer associated anemia
				- Hard to treat because drugs could make cancer worse
				- Iron deficiency I guess isn't that treatable?
			- Tumor colonizes bone and starts to destroy the bone matrix
			- Tumor boundary lined with osteoclasts
		- Iron recycling macrophages are the ones that are particularly disturbed by metastasis
			- Bone marrow has erythroblast island macrophages that feed nascent RBC
			- They're attracted to the tumor - probably because of the metabolism?
				- Tumors take up features of the red blood cells so that it can survive in hypoxic conditions
			- So there's less mature blood cells being made
		- Seems like a cool guy - does ironmans and half marathons with his lab

		- Central question - we lose billions of cells every day, how are they replaced?
			- How do cells locally coordinate tissue regeneration over a lifetime? Things fall apart as you age
		- Help to build the tissue as it's growing - mouse macrophages seed as early as E9
		- Label individual macrophages is difficult, just image all of them
		- Only macrophages in very close proximity respond to injury
			- If you ablate proximal macrophages, there is no compensation
		- Rac1 required to clear (phagocytosis), but there is still some recovery
			- Loss of Rac1 also results in capillary loss over time - macrophages aren't able to efficiently clear debris
		- Remove bone marrow and replace with red labelled
			- New macrophages coming from blood monocytes will be red
			- The new ones go into the lower dermis - upper and epi are locally grown
