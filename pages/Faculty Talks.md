		- Parametrize the central dogma of molecular biology
		- mostly a mass spec lab
		- RNA to protein correlation is really bad
			- xenopus is ~.2 R, ciona is basically 0
			- bacteria is a bit better
				- in steady state you can get up to .5
				- when growing it's not as good
		- try to measure translation rates and degradation rates
			- add parameters to explain the model

		- membrane remodeling via structural biology
		- Specifically focused on membrane fission
			- dynamin, ARF GTPases, ESCRT
		- Structural features that allow fission related proteins to act on different kinds of membranes
		- Relatively new professor
		- Also studies malaria and toxoplasmosis gondii because they have apicoblasts that are 4 membrane layer bound oranelle
		- He seems nice
		- Lots of interesting things going on

		- Host / microbiome interactions
			- ranging from human microbiome in the gut, skin, vagina, mouth
			- to ocean sponges, tunicates, random other organisms
		- Probiotics are bs
			- they're mostly all dead and they leave your system within a day or two
		- Lots of complicated interactions, hard to pin down what's going on in the microbiome
		- All mucosa in the body are connected
			- Immune cells travel between them and can spread inflammation or some other communication
			- Microbes can't really travel between them but it's possible to transmit information
		- Theoretically you can do personalized medicine based entirely on the microbiome

		- Mostly liver infecting viruses
		- Try to be proactive rather than reactive for infectious disease treatment
		- Viral polymerases are error prone
			- This is a very effective way to introduce mutations and continue evolving
		- Theiler nobel prize for the vaccine against yellow fever by culturing it in cells for a few hundred passages
			- Same vaccine is still being used
			- Has about 1/250,000 adverse effects
		- What's the difference between the virulent strain and the immunogenic strain? (live attenuated virus in the vaccine)
			- 2A protein drives immune response, E drives spread
			- E is a structural protein in the viral capsule
			- 2A antagonizes viral defenses
				- Somehow there's a repression of interferon production

		- Gastruloids (not again)
			- theoretically can study human development further than 14 days
		- Mostly genomics based
			- Including spatial? how do you justify spatial on gastruloids?
		- Looking for a comprehensive mammalian cell fate map
			- Shendure paper from a while ago (Qiu Nature 2024)
		- Neural crest -opathies have a shared
		- E.J. Conklin was in princeton way long ago doing lineage tracing on snails
		- Cas9 molecular recorder
			- Genetic barcode inside a cell
		- She's very open about how they aren't perfect
		- How does an NMP decide which branch to go down?
			- ectodermal or mesodermal fate
			- Tracer gives a really good readout of molecular events in the cell
		- NMP at earlier timepoint is close to a somitic cell type, later becomes more neural
			- Excise the NMP tip of the gastruloid and regrow a new gastruloid
			- Second generation has quite a bit more neural fate NMPs
		- Spatially looking at more general things? which cell type has migrations?

			- Loop goes through the ring, has a tail
		- Microcin J25 and Astexin-3
			- super high temperature resistance
			- Protease resistant
			- Large AA (tyrosine, tryptophan, etc) right next to the ring so it doesn't slip through

			- Daisy chain a bunch of these together
			- Two interlocking peptide rings [2]catenane
		- Lassos bind metals? Iron, copper - could be metal chelating from cyanobacteria

		- How does cas13 work?
			- Can target ssRNA but not dsRNA
			- RNA structure matters a lot
			- Kinetics are probably the model
				- Cas13 guide strand displaces RNA structure, and this is harder to do as the RNA is more occluded / closer to double stranded
		- Blocking the Cas13 itself rather than target
			- this makes it way more specific because you need to have a perfect strand match to get strand displacement
		- How does Cas13 search for target RNAs in a cell?
			- Options include non specific binding + sliding length along an RNA
			- Intra-coil diffusion along 3D RNA structure

		- Opines are secondary amines (AA + keto acid / sugar)
			- octopine, nopaline, found in sea creatures
		- Opine is a food for agrobacter, but they want to put it in to plants and use it to feed other bacteria
			- Concern about tumor generation?

		- Structual biology of retrotransposition
		- LINE-1 does self insertion into the genome
		- Target-primed reverse transcription
		- ORF1p and ORF2p come together with LINE-1 mRNA to make an RNP
		- This is a very complicated process and they're going into it with both structual bio and biochemistry
		- RNP uses PCNA
			- maybe for base recognition?
			- Seems to be for improved bottom strand nicking
		- Honestly very cool

		- RNA granules
		- Germ cells are characterized by the presence of germ granules

		- drosophila syncytium already has germ granules
		- Germ granules are determinative - if you get them, you become germ cell
		- homotypic clusters of RNAs on protein scaffold
		- different kinds of granules that need to be mutually excluded

		- Rubisco is normally slow, but some organisms (algae, cyanobacteria, C4 plants (corn)) are a lot faster because they concentrate CO2
		- Algae has all of the rubisco organized into a subdomain of the chloroplast, the pyrenoid
		- 1/3 of global CO2 assimilation happens in a pyrenoid
		- spherical matrix packed with rubisco
			- Large structure, 1-2 um
		- membrane tubules traverse the center
		- surrounded by starch sheath, thought to slow escape of CO2

		- What drives cancer metastasis? How do cancer cells modulate their fitness?
		- Metastatic niches
			- Something has to happen around the location of cancer leaving to organize it
		- Bone is the most common metastatic site in breast cancer
			- cancer associated anemia
				- Hard to treat because drugs could make cancer worse
				- Iron deficiency I guess isn't that treatable?
			- Tumor colonizes bone and starts to destroy the bone matrix
			- Tumor boundary lined with osteoclasts
		- Iron recycling macrophages are the ones that are particularly disturbed by metastasis
			- Bone marrow has erythroblast island macrophages that feed nascent RBC
			- They're attracted to the tumor - probably because of the metabolism?
				- Tumors take up features of the red blood cells so that it can survive in hypoxic conditions
			- So there's less mature blood cells being made
		- Seems like a cool guy - does ironmans and half marathons with his lab

		- Central question - we lose billions of cells every day, how are they replaced?
			- How do cells locally coordinate tissue regeneration over a lifetime? Things fall apart as you age
		- Help to build the tissue as it's growing - mouse macrophages seed as early as E9
		- Label individual macrophages is difficult, just image all of them
		- Only macrophages in very close proximity respond to injury
			- If you ablate proximal macrophages, there is no compensation
		- Rac1 required to clear (phagocytosis), but there is still some recovery
			- Loss of Rac1 also results in capillary loss over time - macrophages aren't able to efficiently clear debris
		- Remove bone marrow and replace with red labelled
			- New macrophages coming from blood monocytes will be red
			- The new ones go into the lower dermis - upper and epi are locally grown
		- Can label individual macrophages with an inducible cre + low dosage of tamoxifen (can fine tune cre activity)
			- Track labeled cell over time
			- Does not move and eventually can divide
			- Lower dermis has much more loss than division (monocyte source)
			- Upper dermis is more balanced, but there's still more loss
		- CSF1 (macrophage growth factor) can expand macrophage population in old mice, and it helps with blood flow too
		- Current projects
		  background-color:: green
			- Development - how to locally coordinate? grad student, paw - rapidly grows in early life, what's going on with cell types there
			- Regeneration - rebuild from scratch? postdoc, distal tip can regenerate, but it's very limited as to where
			- Aging - drivers of impaired regeneration? lab manager, ear punch regeneration is dependent on age and location
