		- Structual biology of retrotransposition
		- LINE-1 does self insertion into the genome
		- Target-primed reverse transcription
		- ORF1p and ORF2p come together with LINE-1 mRNA to make an RNP
		- This is a very complicated process and they're going into it with both structual bio and biochemistry
		- RNP uses PCNA
			- maybe for base recognition?
			- Seems to be for improved bottom strand nicking
		- Honestly very cool

		- Maternal transcription
		- RNA granules
		- Germ cells are characterized by the presence of germ granules
			- asymmetric division, only the cells destined to become gametes inherit the germ granules
		- drosophila syncytium already has germ granules
		- Germ granules are determinative - if you get them, you become germ cell

		- Rubisco is normally slow, but some organisms (algae, cyanobacteria, C4 plants (corn)) are a lot faster because they concentrate CO2
		- Algae has all of the rubisco organized into a subdomain of the chloroplast, the pyrenoid
		- 1/3 of global CO2 assimilation happens in a pyrenoid
		- spherical matrix packed with rubisco
			- Large structure, 1-2 um
		- membrane tubules traverse the center
		- surrounded by starch sheath, thought to slow escape of CO2
		- Very cool, foundational stuff. I think I'm not too interested but it's very exciting work

		- german youth champion in pentathlon and pro basketball player in germany
		- I didn't take any notes but spindle branching
		- Also cool stuff
		- They build a spindle

		- What drives cancer metastasis? How do cancer cells modulate their fitness?
		- Metastatic niches
			- Something has to happen around the location of cancer leaving to organize it
		- Bone is the most common metastatic site in breast cancer
			- cancer associated anemia
				- Hard to treat because drugs could make cancer worse
				- Iron deficiency I guess isn't that treatable?
			- Tumor colonizes bone and starts to destroy the bone matrix
			- Tumor boundary lined with osteoclasts
		- Iron recycling macrophages are the ones that are particularly disturbed by metastasis
			- Bone marrow has erythroblast island macrophages that feed nascent RBC
			- They're attracted to the tumor - probably because of the metabolism?
				- Tumors take up features of the red blood cells so that it can survive in hypoxic conditions
			- So there's less mature blood cells being made
		- Seems like a cool guy - does ironmans and half marathons with his lab

		- Central question - we lose billions of cells every day, how are they replaced?
			- How do cells locally coordinate tissue regeneration over a lifetime? Things fall apart as you age
		- Help to build the tissue as it's growing - mouse macrophages seed as early as E9
		- Label individual macrophages is difficult, just image all of them
		- Only macrophages in very close proximity respond to injury
			- If you ablate proximal macrophages, there is no compensation
		- Rac1 required to clear (phagocytosis), but there is still some recovery
			- Loss of Rac1 also results in capillary loss over time - macrophages aren't able to efficiently clear debris
		- Remove bone marrow and replace with red labelled
			- New macrophages coming from blood monocytes will be red
			- The new ones go into the lower dermis - upper and epi are locally grown
		- Can label individual macrophages with an inducible cre + low dosage of tamoxifen (can fine tune cre activity)
			- Track labeled cell over time
			- Does not move and eventually can divide
			- Lower dermis has much more loss than division (monocyte source)
			- Upper dermis is more balanced, but there's still more loss
		- CSF1 (macrophage growth factor) can expand macrophage population in old mice, and it helps with blood flow too
		- Current projects
		  background-color:: green
			- Development - how to locally coordinate? grad student, paw - rapidly grows in early life, what's going on with cell types there
			- Regeneration - rebuild from scratch? postdoc, distal tip can regenerate, but it's very limited as to where
			- Aging - drivers of impaired regeneration? lab manager, ear punch regeneration is dependent on age and location
