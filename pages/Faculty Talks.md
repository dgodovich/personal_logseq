	- What drives cancer metastasis? How do cancer cells modulate their fitness?
	- Metastatic niches
		- Something has to happen around the location of cancer leaving to organize it
	- Bone is the most common metastatic site in breast cancer
		- cancer associated anemia
			- Hard to treat because drugs could make cancer worse
			- Iron deficiency I guess isn't that treatable?
		- Tumor colonizes bone and starts to destroy the bone matrix
		- Tumor boundary lined with osteoclasts
	- Iron recycling macrophages are the ones that are particularly disturbed by metastasis
		- Bone marrow has erythroblast island macrophages that feed nascent RBC
		- They're attracted to the tumor - probably because of the metabolism?
			- Tumors take up features of the red blood cells so that it can survive in hypoxic conditions
		- So there's less mature blood cells being made
