- Here we demonstrate that the 701 and 708 mutations do indeed suppress each other,

- is phage was then used to lysogenize a strain containing the 708 mutation such that the integrative recombination event occurred between the sites of the two mutation

- The mutations individually were found to reduce the amount of A receptor to approximately equivalent levels—5% and 8% of wild type. When combined, the two mutations suppressed each other, but only toa limited extent. The double mutation restored only 25% of wild-type levels of A receptor activit

- The relatively leaky effect of the 708 mutation can therefore be explained by a less stable hairpin structure and a consequently more accessible ribosome-binding site

- e believe that this alteration of a charged amino acid to a neutral residue in the early hydrophilic portion of the signal sequence’® reduces localization of the A receptor protein to the outer membrane
