  collapsed:: true
	- MCF10A cells are very slow to trypsinze
		- On the order of 30 minutes to get them to stick off the plate
	- Thoughts on using a [[96 well plate]]
		- Do's
			- Fill wells in a rectangle or grid pattern
			- Surround wells that you're using with a moat of DI water or PBS
			- Use single pipet tips
				- This doesn't apply for if you're using the whole plate but for a few wells it's better to have individual tips
			- Fill multiple wells with slightly varying cell densities
				- Counting isn't perfect and this helps to make sure that you will have at least 1 well that has a correct density
		- Don'ts
			- Use the outer wells
			- Go in a line
				- This is more relevant for oil immersion objectives
				- Tracking oil in a circle is better for the microscope than going in a line

	- Media
		- {{embed ((68c1dc8a-1705-4308-84d9-f586f1fed732))}}
		- DMEM/F12 supplemented with 5% horse serum (Invitrogen,16050122), 20 ng/mL EGF (Peprotech, AF-100-15-1MG), 0.5 µg/mL hydrocortisone (Sigma-Aldrich, H0888), 100 ng/mL cholera toxin (Sigma-Aldrich, C8052), 10 µg/mL insulin (Sigma-Aldrich I-1882,), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.
	- Plating for imaging
		- 96 well plates coated with fibronectin
			- glass bottom, black wall. Cellvis, P96-1.5H-N
		- 10 µg/mL fibronectin dissolved in PBS at 37°C for a minimum of 30 min.
			- 200 \mu\L per well
		- After fibronectin coating, wells were washed twice with DI water
			- Can also use PBS but sterility doesn't seem to matter that much
			- Don't sterile filter after adding BSA, and reuse plates after imaging, so it's not a huge deal
		- Seeded at 30,000 cells/well 1 day prior to imaging.
		  background-color:: yellow
		- For improved adhesion, cells were plated into 150 μL of media, then spun down in a tabletop centrifuge for 30 sec.
	- Pre-imaging starvation media change
		- 3 hours prior to imaging
		- growth medium was replaced with low-growth factor “starvation” medium.
			- - horse serum, EGF, and insulin,
			- + 3 mg/mL bovine serum albumin
			- At least 1 hour prior to imaging, medium was replaced with starvation medium containing 0.1uM nuclear dye Hoechst Janelia fluor 646 (Tocris 6804)
				- To get a nuclear marker, but I don't need this I think
	- when you count the cells, don't use trypan blue (but the machine will assume trypan blue so you'll divide total cell count by 2)
- Flask usage
  collapsed:: true
	- T25
		- equivalent to 2 wells of a 6 well plate or a 6cm dish
		- ~5mL media
		- 1mL trypsin
	- T75
		- equivalent to a 10cm dish
		- ~10-12mL media
		- 2mL trypsin
