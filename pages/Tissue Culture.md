- Notes from Jared
	- MCF10A cells are very slow to trypsinze
		- On the order of 30 minutes to get them to stick off the plate
	- Thoughts on using a [[96 well plate]]
	  collapsed:: true
		- Do's
			- Fill wells in a rectangle or grid pattern
			- Surround wells that you're using with a moat of DI water or PBS
			- Use single pipet tips
				- This doesn't apply for if you're using the whole plate but for a few wells it's better to have individual tips
			- Fill multiple wells with slightly varying cell densities
				- Counting isn't perfect and this helps to make sure that you will have at least 1 well that has a correct density
		- Don'ts
			- Use the outer wells
			- Go in a line
				- This is more relevant for oil immersion objectives
				- Tracking oil in a circle is better for the microscope than going in a line

		- MCF10A growth medium consisted of DMEM/F12 supplemented with 5% horse serum (Invitrogen,16050122), 20 ng/mL EGF (Peprotech, AF-100-15-1MG), 0.5 µg/mL hydrocortisone (Sigma-Aldrich, H0888), 100 ng/mL cholera toxin (Sigma-Aldrich, C8052), 10 µg/mL insulin (Sigma-Aldrich I-1882,), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.
	- Cells were imaged on glass-bottom, black-walled 96-well plates (Cellvis, P96-1.5H-N) coated with fibronectin.
	- Wells of 96-well plates were first incubated with 10 µg/mL fibronectin dissolved in PBS at 37°C for a minimum of 30 min. After fibronectin coating, wells were washed twice with DI water and seeded at 30,000 cells/well 1 day prior to imaging. For improved adhesion, cells were plated into 150 μL of media, then spun down in a tabletop centrifuge for 30 sec. 3 hours prior to imaging, growth medium was replaced with low-growth factor “starvation” medium. Starvation medium was identical to growth medium, but lacked horse serum, EGF, and insulin, and was supplemented with 3 mg/mL bovine serum albumin. At least 1 hour prior to imaging, medium was replaced with starvation medium containing 0.1uM nuclear dye Hoechst Janelia fluor 646 (Tocris 6804). All cells were maintained at 37°C and 5% CO2.

- when you count the cells, don't use trypan blue (but the machine will assume trypan blue so you'll divide total cell count by 2)
