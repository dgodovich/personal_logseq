- Notes from Jared
	- MCF10A cells are very slow to trypsinze
		- On the order of 30 minutes to get them to stick off the plate
	- Thoughts on using a [[96 well plate]]
		- Do's
			- Fill wells in a rectangle or grid pattern
			- Surround wells that you're using with a moat of DI water or PBS
			- Use single pipet tips
				- This doesn't apply for if you're using the whole plate but for a few wells it's better to have individual tips
			- Fill multiple wells with slightly varying cell densities
				- Counting isn't perfect and this helps to make sure that you will have at least 1 well that has a correct density
		- Don'ts
			- Use the outer wells
			- Go in a line
				- This is more relevant for oil immersion objectives
				- Tracking oil in a circle is better for the microscope than going in a line

		- ~5mL media
		- 1mL trypsin
	- T75
