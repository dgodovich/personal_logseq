- [[Abstract]]
	- The Ras/PI3K/extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) signaling network plays fundamental roles in cell growth, survival, and migration and is frequently activated in cancer. Here, we show that the activities of the signaling network propagate as coordinated waves, biased by growth factor, which drive actin-based protrusions in human epithelial cells. The network exhibits hallmarks of biochemical excitability: the annihilation of oppositely directed waves, all-or-none responsiveness, and refractoriness. Abrupt perturbations to Ras, PI(4,5)P2, PI(3,4)P2, ERK, and TORC2 alter the threshold, observations that define positive and negative feedback loops within the network. Oncogenic transformation dramatically increases the wave activity, the frequency of ERK pulses, and the sensitivity to EGF stimuli. Wave activity was progressively enhanced across a series of increasingly metastatic breast cancer cell lines. The view that oncogenic transformation is a shift to a lower threshold of excitable Ras/PI3K/ERK network, caused by various combinations of genetic insults, can facilitate the assessment of cancer severity and effectiveness of interventions.

- so this paper does kind of what I want to do but it's not quite in the same way, which I think is ok
- They're showing that phosphorylation proceeds through the cell as a wave
	- and that actin and PI3K phospho are synchronous
	- and ERK activation happens there too
- The difference with what I want to do is to do this within the context of signaling waves that are seen in wound healing
	- So we get externally driven Erk pulsatility, how does that translate through the cell membrane?
- they use KTR for ERK
	- I think trying FRET for this is also more informative
		- gets deeper at cell level signal transduction
- stimulate globally with EGF wash
	- optogenetics can be more spatially and temporally resolved
