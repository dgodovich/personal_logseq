- Most every school is optional on the GRE, I don't think any I'm applying to require it
- $35 per sending score, so I'm not sure that it's worth it if it's optional for everything?
- Duke and Johns Hopkins already have it
	- But to the wrong department which is funny
	- DUKE UNIVERSITY (5156) BIOMEDICAL/MEDICAL ENGINEERING (1603)
	- Johns Hopkins University, School of Engineering (4655)
	- I wonder if this is transferrable
- Optional:
	- Princeton
	- Duke
	- UCSF
	- UW
- Not accepted:
	- Harvard
