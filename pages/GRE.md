- Most every school is optional on the GRE, I don't think any I'm applying to require it
- $35 per sending score, so I'm not sure that it's worth it if it's optional for everything?
- Duke and Johns Hopkins already have it
	- But to the wrong department for duke which is funny
	- DUKE UNIVERSITY (5156) BIOMEDICAL/MEDICAL ENGINEERING (1603)
		- Call or email Duke or ETS to ask about this?
		- it's administered in the same school so I feel like it should be fine
	- Johns Hopkins University, School of Engineering (4655)
- Some schools have you self report on the application and then add? You need to send the official score but maybe that's good enough.

		- That didn't happen with Duke so maybe they don't have it
