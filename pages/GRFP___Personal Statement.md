- General Structure
	- 1-2 paragraph introduction
		- Big thesis of my personal statement should be that I am really into regeneration / wound healing and that I want to combine engineering approaches with biology
			- Hook / intro in the beginning has to really hit on both of these points
			- My personal statements have good phrasing of these
	- IM
		- SoP can get slotted into IM
			- add on some Princeton stuff
			- edit SoP to have a deeper focus on wound healing and applying engineering, continuously hitting on the thesis from the intro
		- Princeton stuff
			- I think I need to discuss at least a little here what my plans are for creating collaborations in the department
			- probably would be good to mention co-mentorship as a possibility?
	- BI has additional CV expansion
		- Here's where I talk about extensive teaching and outreach work
	- Future Goals
		- This one is a bit more nebulous
-
- Intellectual Merit
	- engineering approaches for biological questions is my whole shtick
- Broader Impacts
	- outreach and education are my primary broader impacts angles I think
	- Outreach
		- BMES
			- ICK! leadership for multiple years
			- Extended track record of working with local groups and engaging kids
				- This feeds into the NSF goals of STEM education,
		- RockEDU Science Saturday
		- Fencing? this isn't science but shows that I'm a leader in my communities? I think it could be useful
	- Education
	- [ARIS from Rutgers for citations for broader impacts, might be nice to have one or two?](https://aris.marine.rutgers.edu/)
