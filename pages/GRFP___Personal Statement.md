- Outline plan of what I have to do:
	- Intro
		- This needs to be a bit longer and hit on the main points
		- Thesis is "using a combination of engineering and biology approaches to ask and answer questions in wound healing"
			- That is what I want to do in my PhD
		- GRFP is really about what kind of PhD student do you want to be
			- I want to be a biologist who uses engineering approaches I think
			- I think fundamentally I don't want to be an engineer
				- Problem solving is exciting to me, but that's the engineering approach
				- I don't really want to do tool dev which is the engineer's way
			- This is what Jared was telling me (and I think Sheina, and some other people)
		- I think if possible try to sell it a bit more (in IM?) about why engineering approaches are necessary for wound healing questions
			- This is pretty self-explanatory to me, but that isn't actually true
	- IM
		- Princeton Paragraph
			- Edit my stream of consciousness
			- Main points to hit here are
				- Engineering vs biology program and why I chose this one
					- Furthering that, how it's already given me this biology framework thinking
					- genetic screens, prokaryotic foundational concepts, etc
				- Fostering collaboration between Danelle, Jared, and Kai
					- This is the dream team for longitudinal studies of wound healing efficacy and aging
					- They're already starting down this path, but I think I can be a good intermediary between them
		- Rotation with Jared
			- This might be worth making into its whole own paragraph
				- actually for sure should be
			- Highlight that this is me leveraging my unique skillset
				- programming for biological control
				- Really thinking about biological systems "like an engineer"
			- Getting data and potential applications of that?
		- Editing existing paragraphs
			- In the interest of time I think I won't/can't do this that much
			- Add something referencing planned single cell / other computational experiments from research plan in the MSK paragraph
			- Some slight pivoting a bit closer to the thesis, but I think this is not 100% needed / already most of the way there
		- See how long it is after this and then revisit
	- BI
		- Edit my word salad
		- Main points to hit here
			- Teaching paragraph
				- EDD / chem341
					- this is nice because that's really fostering stem outreach
					- Maybe can say something about public institution?
						- Could be a valid point, but that might get kinda hairy
				- tutoring?
				- EduMate
				- Connect-in-place
				- I think I could mention tutoring in latin in high school but I'm not sure that that's actually effective
			- Outreach paragraph
				- ICK
				- community day
				- science saturday
				- Starting to work with MBOP
			- Community engagement
				- Panels for EDD, WCAC
			- Future plans
				- Continuing to do outreach
				- Want to pivot more towards adult outreach to promote science education
					- This also might have some hairy sentences I have to be careful with
					- Science comedy, informal talks
					- Here's the CST / LabTales plug
-
- General Structure
	- 1-2 paragraph introduction
		- Big thesis of my personal statement should be that I am really into regeneration / wound healing and that I want to combine engineering approaches with biology
			- Hook / intro in the beginning has to really hit on both of these points
			- My personal statements have good phrasing of these
	- IM
		- SoP can get slotted into IM
			- add on some Princeton stuff
			- edit SoP to have a deeper focus on wound healing and applying engineering, continuously hitting on the thesis from the intro
		- Princeton stuff
			- I think I need to discuss at least a little here what my plans are for creating collaborations in the department
			- probably would be good to mention co-mentorship as a possibility?
			- Rotation in Jared Toettcher's lab
				- Do I mention rotating? Or just in Jared Toettcher's lab I have been doing....
				- human cell culture work in a inducible migratory system with optogenetics
			- Collaborations
	- BI has additional CV expansion
		- Here's where I talk about extensive teaching and outreach work
	- Future Goals
		- This one is a bit more nebulous
-
- Intellectual Merit
	- engineering approaches for biological questions is my whole shtick
- Broader Impacts
	- outreach and education are my primary broader impacts angles I think
	- Outreach
		- BMES
			- ICK! leadership for multiple years
			- Extended track record of working with local groups and engaging kids
				- This feeds into the NSF goals of STEM education,
		- RockEDU Science Saturday
		- Fencing? this isn't science but shows that I'm a leader in my communities? I think it could be useful
	- Education
	- [ARIS from Rutgers for citations for broader impacts, might be nice to have one or two?](https://aris.marine.rutgers.edu/)
