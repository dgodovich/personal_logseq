	- mid/H15 tandem paralogs in fly
		- homologous to TBX20 which is important for cardiac development
	- gene dosage is more than just the number of copies
		- there can be (often are) synergistic effects
		- having two copies gets you more than double the effect
	- Enhancer searching is hard
	- enhancer bashing to figure out what section is important
		- you can really zoom in to a particular sequence, can be a small region
	- Duplication of an enhancer makes the fly unable to lay eggs

	- same as retreat talk but longer format
	- FGF signaling / receptor disentangling
	- terminal cells in drosophila larval trachea can be counted by FGF/ERK gain or loss
	- pY tag -> add additional tyrosines on RTK to get readout of activity
		- Emily Ho in Toettcher lab
	- FGF seems to only be required for the terminal cell fate
		- branch is able to extend, fusion cell forms fine
		- What drives this if it's not FGF?

  collapsed:: true
	- immunologist by training, dev bio in the last few years
	- Mother and offspring are evolutionary partners
	- Infection has impacts on child's life
		- but could also be good?
	- How does the mothers tissue immunity adapt?
	- Focus on barrier tissues
		- gut, lungs, skin
	- Large increase on eosinophils in the duodenum of lactating mothers
		- Contribution to tissue remodeling?
	- crypt and villi are longer
		- fewer stem cells, more differentiated goblet cells
			- these are the ones that do mucus secretion
	- Lactating mice have additional protections against illness
	- retain protections for up to 12 weeks post-lactation
	- What's the mechanism for this? Is it lactation dependent?
		- [[Liz Gavis]] asked this question right after I thought of it which is nice
		- Yes, it is lactation dependent
			- When you remove pups from the mother on day 1 after birth the protection is not established
		- Not yet clear what that signal is
	- Eosinophils typically respond to parasites, and I guess the fetus is a type of parasite
	- Lungs have more neutrophils
