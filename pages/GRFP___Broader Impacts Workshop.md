		- this is easiest with engineering or applied things
		- framing research in a larger context. Articulate why it's important
	- Activities that are directly related to research project
		- citizen science
	- Activities that are supported by but are complementary to the research project
		- going into classes, teaching, tutoring
- Should be excited by broader impacts
	- this is how you can actually communicate that you're going to do it and you want to do it, and they can tell
