- Went great!
- Jared's main feedback is to bother the PI more
	- Talking about the problem with ideas is that he's full of them but doesn't know how to assign
	- Things that matter in that assignment are how busy you are, your bandwidth for new ideas, reception to new ideas
	- Especially as a first year / early graduate student, interacting with the PI is important and how you build that relationship
	- This is something that I've previously struggled with in Kat's lab
		- I never talked to her, and I thought that was part of her style / me being a tech, but it's also definitely on me in some sense
		- Need to reach out and have more continuous informal interactions
- Harrison's paper got revisions!
	- They need to show some more radial stuff
	- I think my density things are going in the paper which is kinda crazy
	- and Matteo's which is awesome
	- coauthorship from a rotation moment
- Co-mentoring is a possibility
	- Requires PIs to have a scope of project already planned out and have it be feasible
	- One of the issues with co-mentorship is that if a project doesn't work, which happens all the time, you're more restricted in the available search space of potential research ideas
	- So with that in mind, it's a bit harder to plan for a comentorship with [[Kai Mesa]] since his stuff is so new and not really established yet
		- They are working on a grant together
	- [[Danelle Devenport]] is more possible as they already have joint funding and existing collaborations
	- But, Jared generally is looking to expand the application of his opto tools into translational settings
		- and this requires a mouse model that he will be getting from a collaboration
