- [[Abstract]]
	- We constructed a derivative of transposon TnS that permits the generation of hybrid proteins composed of alkaline phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.1) lacking its signal peptide fused to amino-terminal sequences of other proteins. Such a hybrid gives alkaline phosphatase activity if the protein fused to alkaline phosphatase contributes sequences that promote export and thus compensate for the missing alkaline phosphatase signal peptide. Fusions to both a secreted periplasmic protein and a complex cytoplasmic membrane protein led to alkaline phosphatase activity. TnphoA fusions should help localize export signals within the structure of a protein, such as a transmembrane protein, as well as identify new chromosomal genes for secreted and transmembrane proteins.
