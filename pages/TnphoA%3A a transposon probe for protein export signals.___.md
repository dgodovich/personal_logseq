- [[Abstract]]
	- We constructed a derivative of transposon TnS that permits the generation of hybrid proteins composed of alkaline phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.1) lacking its signal peptide fused to amino-terminal sequences of other proteins. Such a hybrid gives alkaline phosphatase activity if the protein fused to alkaline phosphatase contributes sequences that promote export and thus compensate for the missing alkaline phosphatase signal peptide. Fusions to both a secreted periplasmic protein and a complex cytoplasmic membrane protein led to alkaline phosphatase activity. TnphoA fusions should help localize export signals within the structure of a protein, such as a transmembrane protein, as well as identify new chromosomal genes for secreted and transmembrane proteins.

- Tn5 transposase! ATACseq??
- Protein fusions are important for study of protein export
	- most of these use \beta\gal, but this can't pass through the cytoplasmic membrane
	- so use alkaline phosphatase instead so that you can get into periplasm
	- You can attach different signal sequences and get them through
- Use transposon to do this attachment in vivo

	- opal stop mutant
	- They use lac to screen for transposition into plasmids
		- also use a high concentration of kanamycin to select for multicopy
	- plasmid are described elsewhere bruh
- Construct a derivative of Tn5 that has alkaline phosphatase on one end
	- but without the signal sequence, importantly
	- so this should transfer phoA when it jumps
	- schematic of this shown in figure 1
	- I'm not sure I really understand how recombination works
		- why does it switch direction
- Test function by transferring \beta\lactamase, periplasmic location
- There's an opal nonsense mutation at the junction between phoA and IS50L sequence fragment
	- this isn't ideal
	- They expected this, so they used an opal suppressor strain
	- mutate with a selection for plasmid linked suppressor independent expression of phoA
- Figure 2 has a western blot that didn't work lmao
	- B3 has no band
