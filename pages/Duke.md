- Program Information:
	- [Stats](https://gradschool.duke.edu/about/statistics/)
		- [dev bio specific stats](https://gradschool.duke.edu/about/statistics/developmental-and-stem-cell-biology-phd-admissions-and-enrollment-statistics/)
		- a bit under 20% acceptance rate
	- Graduate school is divided into Medical school, arts and sciences, and engineering (and others)
		- Medical school has the [Office of Biomedical Graduate Education](https://medschool.duke.edu/education/biomedical-phd-programs/office-biomedical-graduate-education) that covers all the programs I care about like dev and stem cell bio, cmb, etc
	- Dev bio is not degree granting, you get it from one of the other departments
		- But I will be applying directly to it
- Notes after acceptance
	- Holy shit I got accepted
	- Should arrive in Durham by August 11
	- August 19 is new grad student orientation
	- biocore would be earlier than this but I think I will not be doing that
- Info session
  collapsed:: true
	- Campus is contiguous - eveything isvey close by (medical school, engineeing, biology)
	- over 60 facutly in DSCB
	- DSCB currently has 41 students
	- earn a certificate in Dev bio, but phd granting department is a different one, most students are in CMB
	- Adjacent to the undergrad campus as well
	- Smaller program with around 8 students matriculating a year
		- Strong community because of this, I have seen this with Woon

	- [check out these faculty members in the duke regeneration center](https://sites.duke.edu/dukeregenerationcenter/affiliated-faculty/)
		- none of them have primary appointments in dev bio which is interesting
			- Oh it's because no one has a primary appointment in dev bio lmao
	- scraped csv of faculty members available at web_scraping
	- Varghese is not in the regeneration center but also looks cool
	- was about to write Poss but he's moving his lab to UW (wisconsin)
		- this also means probably no Stefano because his work in regeneration was with Poss
			- They are continuing collaborations and Stefano has his own fish stuff
		- Woon's friend said something about Dave sherwood also leaving to wisconsin? But I don't see that anywhere
			- He is not

			- I did not like talking to her at all
			- She has never taken a dscb student and gave 0 insight about what a potential project would look like in her lab. Doesn't seem all that supportive
	- [Donald Fox](https://www.foxlabduke.com/)
		- codon bias and hypertrophy in regeneration
		- Talk to Rebecca in the Lai lab, she just got her phd in his lab
