	- parabolic mirror used to align "collimate" the light
	- LEDs are very efficient and generally make narrow band light
		- can have multiple colors by using RGB
		- or use a blue LED + phosphor to emit broad white light
			- this one you can't control, but you can tune phosphor color temperature
	- Stimulated emission of radiation
		- electron can decay to ground state by being hit by an incoming photon
		- Incoming photon has to have E = E_gap
		- outgoing photons are in phase and have the same energy - copies
	- Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission or Radiation (LASER)
		- need to get everything into the excited state, but then it all goes together
		- mirrors at ends to bounce the generated light back and forth
	- Most microscopes are continuous CW output
		- 2 photon excitation needs to have very high photon density
			- pulsed lasers avoid frying your sample
	- Can pass a laser through a crystal or fiber to get a continuum laser
		- pretty efficient, not quite broadband but it's pretty good
	- Convert photos to

  collapsed:: true
	- I should try to find my notes from bioimaging from senior year
	- Plane waves coming into a flat interface all bend in the same direction
		- curved interface you would have convergence or divergence because of the different face angle
	- Lenses focus light but you can have aberrations from not super correct focusing
		- astigmatism is left to right
		- spherical aberration is radial
		- chromatic aberration - rainbow effect from white light bc the different colors refract differently
	- distance f; focal length
		- $1/f = (n-1)[1/R_1 + 1/R_2]$
		- where n is the index of refraction, R1 and R2 are the radii of curvature on either side of the lens
	- cylindrical lens also works and you get a focal line
		- convergence in only 1 direction
		- useful for super resolution imaging
	- objects can be thought of as collections of point sources of light emanating in all directions
	- parallel interfaces
	- image created on the other side of the lens
		- this is not a point source because it's not an emitter
		- upside down compared to input object
	- when object is at focal length, image is infinitely far away
		- so then you put another lens that has the object at infinity and the image at focal length
		- $1/o + 1/i = 1/f; M = -i/o$
		- o is distance of object, i is distance of image, f is focal length
	- virtual image is where you can't see the image because it looks like it's coming from behind the object and you can't actually detect the image
		- magnifying glasses make virtual images - upright image
		- appears further away and bigger
	- concave lenses only ever make virtual images bc it's a diverging lens
	- stacking lenses allows you to change the effective focal length
	- ABCD method for ray propagation
		- what's going on inside your optical system
		- matrix multiplication
		- $\begin{pmatrix} r' \\ \theta'  \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} A & B \\ C & D \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} r \\ \theta \end{pmatrix}$
	- microscope objectives have one million lenses inside that are all thin film coated
		- these guys don't have movement, you move the whole thing to change focus
		- sometimes it has an adjustment collar for immersion / media index of refraction
	- Numerical aperture is the size of the opening (roughly)
		- how much light can the objective lens collect
		- ratio of diameter to focal length
		- $NA_i \approx n \frac{D}{2f}$
		- maximum NA is the index of refraction of the material
		- higher numbers also correlate with higher collection angle, ~1.5 you get almost 150 degrees
	- Infinity corrected objectives make everything easier because you can move it arbitrarily far
	- condenser lens to focus the illumination

  collapsed:: true
	- Most microscopes just kinda work, but it's useful to know about it anyway
	- light propagates changes of EM fields
	- spherical wavefronts are from average emission
		- intensity goes down as a function of 1/r^2 as surface area goes up
		- from a point source of light
	- Plane waves propagate in a perpendicular direction
		- doesn't actually exist but is a good approximation
	- looking at a spherical wave from far away looks like a plane wave
	- rays are perpendicular to wavefronts
	- Light oscillations don't really matter because you're always averaging it
		- It's always going to be integrated over the exposure time
		- temporal
	- Spatial structure does matter - hundreds of nm scale is relevant for biology
	- polarizing filters block off direction oscillations
		- light that passes through actually makes a new wave
		- can control intensity by rotating a set of polarizing filters
		- beam splitters create two beams by splitting unpolarized light into horizontal and vertical
		- half waves are easy to move in one axis, hard in the other, so they slow the wave in one direction and it rotates
		- use a half wave plate to control amplitude between two polarizing filters so that it's always the same direction coming out
	- E = hv = hc/\lambda
	- Wave view of light has energy as amplitude, particle view has number of particles (photons)
	- Silver is a good reflector for visible light but kinda bad for other wavelengths
	- curved mirrors turn plane waves into spherical waves
	- Steer lasers and whatever with mirrors by rotating and tilting them
	- Dichroic mirrors reflect one wavelength and transmit the other
		- mostly thin film interference things
	- refractive index of water is 1.3, glass is 1.5
		- Snells law
		- Dispersion is when the index of refraction depends on the color
	- total internal reflection has no transmittance
		- fiber optics
		- TIRF
			- you get a little bit of electric field into the sample at the very surface
			- Can use this to excite molecules right at the surface
