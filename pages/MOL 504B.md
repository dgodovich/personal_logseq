	- You get the same blurring in Z as in x and y but it's even worse
		- $\Delta z = \frac{2\lambda n}{(NA)^2} \approx 500-700nm$
		- so you get hourglass like shapes
		- This means that you get light from other planes that you don't want to be imaging
		- Blob is stretched out in Z 2-3x as in xy-axis
	- Wide field imaging can't focus as well because you get light everywhere
	- Depth of field is a function of aperture size
		- How much is in focus (like camera f stop)
		- wider aperture =  shallow depth of field (+ more light)
		- narrower aperture = larger depth of field (+ less light)
	- Confocal works with this principle to remove light from outside the focus plane
		- Aperture (pinhole) only allows focused light to arrive to photodetector
		- physical rejection of out of focus light
	- Pinhole reduces PSF
		- Big equation for what z you get, refer to slides
		- \Delta\z gets to be ~350 which is a lot better but still worse than xy
	- Point scanning confocal
		- sequential and slow, with high bleaching
		- PMT detector
		- high res
		- optical steering with laser is a bit faster
			- galvo mirror with x y control to raster across focus plane
	- spinning disk confocal
		- thousands of pinholes using a rotating disk looks like a normal image on a camera
		- camera detector
		- very fast and less bleaching
		- Not as high res and some artifacts
		- 3 image planes
			- Sample is imaged onto pinhole disk, pinhole disk is imaged onto the camera
		- Spinning the microlens and pinhole disks mostly covers the full area when you do it really fast
	- Spinning disk has less laser power than confocal because it's always acquiring
		- You have no dead time bleaching
		- There's also less light going in to the sample
		- And you image way faster so there's less overall light going in
	- Re: pinhole size
		- laser scanning you change the pinhole with the wavelength so maximize light
		- But you don't reallyyy have to do this
		- And you usually don't in spinning disk because it's "good enough"
	- 2-photon
		- Simultaneous excitation with two lower energy (higher wavelength) photons
			- e.g. 2 750nm photons = 1 350nm
		- Because you need two events to happen at the same exact time, this is really limited to your focal depth
			- Probability of two photon excitation = light density distribution ^2
		- Longer wavelengths also don't scatter as much in biological samples
			- this makes a less blurry image
		- You need wayyyy more power so it's a way bigger laser
			- $I_{2-photon-excitation} \propto I_{laser}^2 \propto (\frac{P_{avg}}{F_{rep}\tau})^2$
			- So you need very high laser power
		- Dyes aren't as bright, fluorophores are also way less bright
		- Shouldn't do 2-photon unless you have to go deep into a sample, but then you kinda have to
	- Total Internal Reflection Microscopy (TIRF)
		- $I(z) \propto e^{-z/d}$
		- $d = \frac{\lambda}{4\pi} \sqrt{n_2^2\sin^2\theta-n_1^2} \sim 100nm$
		- Light into samples decays inside sample as an exponential with distance so you only get surface
		- Z sectioning but only for 1 plane
		- Use a high NA objective - has to be bigger than 1.33
		- Shine light right on the side straight up and then it TIRs over to the other side
- [[Nov 11th, 2025]] Resolution
  collapsed:: true
	- Spatial frequency that can get captured by the optics of the microscope is what limits the resolution
	- Lenses make a fourier transform
		- objective lens takes forward fourier transform
			- this is flat because there's an equal amplitude for each spatial frequency
		- tube lens does an inverse
		- aperture filters out high frequencies
			- further away from the center is higher frequency
			- This is a physical low pass filter
		- larger aperture has a smaller airy disk (gaussian blob)
			- wider aperture = more detail
	- Resolution limit or Rayleigh criterion is related to wavelength
		- $\frac{\lambda}{2NA} \approx 200nm$
	- can filter on specific directions for edge detection
	- Optical transfer function is a linear loss of signal as you get closer to resolution cutoff
		- but you can measure this and account for it
			- measure the PSF (Point Spread Function) with a known bright sample (bead)
		- deconvolution
	- blur can be thought of as a convolution between the PSF and the ideal point sources of light
	- one of the great things about fourier transform is that it makes a convolution into a product so you avoid double integral
	- Types of deconvolution
		- Inverse filter (in fourier space)
		- iterative algorithm

- [[Nov 4th, 2025]] Fluorescence Microscopy
  collapsed:: true
	- Problem with DIC and phase contrast is that you don't really know what you're looking at
	- Bind specific molecules to things that we understand
		- genetically encoding it or doing an antibody
	- most dyes have aromatic systems
		- These are responsive to polarized light because there's an axis of the rings
	- There's some finite number of photons that can come out of the fluorophore
		- bc they switch to phosphorescence which sucks
	- Different dyes bleach at different rates
		- can normalize to the starting position, but that influences background too
	- can label proteins (lysine or cysteine residues) with dyes
		- chemical linkage, done in a kit
	- GFP and other fluorescent proteins have size
		- can significantly impact protein function
	- Epifluorescence is same side illumination
		- emitted light goes back through the objective
		- get specific filter and dichroic for each fluorophore
	- Can design one pass filter set or a multi-band pass filter
	- worst autofluorescence is coming from UV/blue absorption and emission in green
		- 488 is probably the worst, 405 can also be bad
	- You also have overlap of spectra
		- You can unmix spectra with linear algebra or unsupervised clustering
		- theoretically this can unmix many colors but for practical reasons it's hard
	- FRET can be used to make mixed probes that give you more "colors"
		- not actually colors, different efficiency
- [[Oct 30th, 2025]] Contrast Enhancement
  collapsed:: true
	- Cells are mostly made of water so they don't really scatter light in an aqueous medium
		- This means you get pretty low contrast
		- Microscopy techniques need to do some form of contrast enhancement
	- Dark field microscopy has a very steep angle
		- doesn't get any light from the objective, only light that's scattered at very high angles
		- so you basically only see edges
		- and you need a ton of light
	- wavelength depends on index of refraction
		- $\lambda_n = \frac{\lambda_{air}}{n}$
	- count number of wavelengths to get optical path length
	- small difference in index of refraction gives you a big difference in phase
		- interfere light from cells with light not going through cells to get out that difference
	- Phase contrast
		- illuminating light is interfered with scattered light by a specially designed phase ring that gives them opposite phases
			- so you get black background
			- you actually have to go through a gray filter ring so that you don't just get darkness bc that looks bad
		- negative vs positive phase contrast does either constructive or destructive interference respectively
		- condenser annulus opening size and geometry makes the halos and other specifics
	- can measure phase difference with a known n or d to measure height or n which is kinda cool
	- polarization microscopy is useful for larger specimens or crystals, can do label free imaging
	- Differential Interference microscopy
		- polarization microscope with fancy stuff in the middle
		- Wollaston prism is like a polarizing beam splitter but it doesn't reflect, it changes angle
			- regular would transmit one, reflect the other
			- this one bends angle for both of them but still splits
			- there's a direction associated with the splitting
		- DIC has a wollaston prism on both sides, one to split, one to come together
		- different polarizations have different interactions with the sample
			- one direction will get a phase delay and then you get elliptical polarized light on the other side
			- you need to have one ray go through the sample and the other to not
				- i.e. go through an edge
				- only the edges are visible
		- Contrast only in one direction because of the directionality of the wollaston prism
			- can "fix" this by phase shifting one direction arbitrarily so then you get "3d" looking shapes
			- still have no contrast in the perpendicular direction but they look better
		- polarizer at the end blocks all light that doesn't interact with sample
- [[Oct 28th, 2025]] Illumination and Detection
  collapsed:: true
	- parabolic mirror used to align "collimate" the light
	- LEDs are very efficient and generally make narrow band light
		- can have multiple colors by using RGB
		- or use a blue LED + phosphor to emit broad white light
			- this one you can't control, but you can tune phosphor color temperature
	- Stimulated emission of radiation
		- electron can decay to ground state by being hit by an incoming photon
		- Incoming photon has to have E = E_gap
		- outgoing photons are in phase and have the same energy - copies
	- Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission or Radiation (LASER)
		- need to get everything into the excited state, but then it all goes together
		- mirrors at ends to bounce the generated light back and forth
	- Most microscopes are continuous CW output
		- 2 photon excitation needs to have very high photon density
			- pulsed lasers avoid frying your sample
	- Can pass a laser through a crystal or fiber to get a continuum laser
		- pretty efficient, not quite broadband but it's pretty good
	- Convert photons to numbers through the photoelectric effect
		- photodiode is the reverse of an LED
	- Use an ADC to get a discrete value
	- EMCCD use hardware electron multiplication to get pre-amp gain

  collapsed:: true
	- I should try to find my notes from bioimaging from senior year
	- Plane waves coming into a flat interface all bend in the same direction
		- curved interface you would have convergence or divergence because of the different face angle
	- Lenses focus light but you can have aberrations from not super correct focusing
		- astigmatism is left to right
		- spherical aberration is radial
		- chromatic aberration - rainbow effect from white light bc the different colors refract differently
	- distance f; focal length
		- $1/f = (n-1)[1/R_1 + 1/R_2]$
		- where n is the index of refraction, R1 and R2 are the radii of curvature on either side of the lens
	- cylindrical lens also works and you get a focal line
		- convergence in only 1 direction
		- useful for super resolution imaging
	- objects can be thought of as collections of point sources of light emanating in all directions
	- parallel interfaces
	- image created on the other side of the lens
		- this is not a point source because it's not an emitter
		- upside down compared to input object
	- when object is at focal length, image is infinitely far away
		- so then you put another lens that has the object at infinity and the image at focal length
		- $1/o + 1/i = 1/f; M = -i/o$
		- o is distance of object, i is distance of image, f is focal length
	- virtual image is where you can't see the image because it looks like it's coming from behind the object and you can't actually detect the image
		- magnifying glasses make virtual images - upright image
		- appears further away and bigger
	- concave lenses only ever make virtual images bc it's a diverging lens
	- stacking lenses allows you to change the effective focal length
	- ABCD method for ray propagation
		- what's going on inside your optical system
		- matrix multiplication
		- $\begin{pmatrix} r' \\ \theta'  \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} A & B \\ C & D \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} r \\ \theta \end{pmatrix}$
	- microscope objectives have one million lenses inside that are all thin film coated
		- these guys don't have movement, you move the whole thing to change focus
		- sometimes it has an adjustment collar for immersion / media index of refraction
	- Numerical aperture is the size of the opening (roughly)
		- how much light can the objective lens collect
		- ratio of diameter to focal length
		- $NA_i \approx n \frac{D}{2f}$
		- maximum NA is the index of refraction of the material
		- higher numbers also correlate with higher collection angle, ~1.5 you get almost 150 degrees
	- Infinity corrected objectives make everything easier because you can move it arbitrarily far
	- condenser lens to focus the illumination
- [[Oct 21st, 2025]] Physics overview
  collapsed:: true
	- Most microscopes just kinda work, but it's useful to know about it anyway
	- light propagates changes of EM fields
	- spherical wavefronts are from average emission
		- intensity goes down as a function of 1/r^2 as surface area goes up
		- from a point source of light
	- Plane waves propagate in a perpendicular direction
		- doesn't actually exist but is a good approximation
	- looking at a spherical wave from far away looks like a plane wave
	- rays are perpendicular to wavefronts
	- Light oscillations don't really matter because you're always averaging it
		- It's always going to be integrated over the exposure time
		- temporal
	- Spatial structure does matter - hundreds of nm scale is relevant for biology
	- polarizing filters block off direction oscillations
		- light that passes through actually makes a new wave
		- can control intensity by rotating a set of polarizing filters
		- beam splitters create two beams by splitting unpolarized light into horizontal and vertical
		- half waves are easy to move in one axis, hard in the other, so they slow the wave in one direction and it rotates
		- use a half wave plate to control amplitude between two polarizing filters so that it's always the same direction coming out
	- E = hv = hc/\lambda
	- Wave view of light has energy as amplitude, particle view has number of particles (photons)
	- Silver is a good reflector for visible light but kinda bad for other wavelengths
	- curved mirrors turn plane waves into spherical waves
	- Steer lasers and whatever with mirrors by rotating and tilting them
	- Dichroic mirrors reflect one wavelength and transmit the other
		- mostly thin film interference things
	- refractive index of water is 1.3, glass is 1.5
		- Snells law
		- Dispersion is when the index of refraction depends on the color
	- total internal reflection has no transmittance
		- fiber optics
		- TIRF
			- you get a little bit of electric field into the sample at the very surface
			- Can use this to excite molecules right at the surface
