	- Most microscopes just kinda work, but it's useful to know about it anyway
	- light propagates changes of EM fields
	- spherical wavefronts are from average emission
		- intensity goes down as a function of 1/r^2 as surface area goes up
		- from a point source of light
	- Plane waves propagate in a perpendicular direction
		- doesn't actually exist but is a good approximation
	- looking at a spherical wave from far away looks like a plane wave
	- rays are perpendicular to wavefronts
	- Light oscillations don't really matter because you're always averaging it
		- It's always going to be integrated over the exposure time
		- temporal
	- Spatial structure does matter - hundreds of nm scale is relevant for biology
	- polarizing filters block off direction oscillations
		- light that passes through actually makes a new wave
		- can control intensity by rotating a set of polarizing filters
		- beam splitters create two beams by splitting unpolarized light into horizontal and vertical
		- half waves are easy to move in one axis, hard in the other, so they slow the wave in one direction and it rotates
		- use a half wave plate to control amplitude between two polarizing filters so that it's always the same direction coming out
	- E = hv = hc/\lambda
	- Wave view of light has energy as amplitude, particle view has number of particles (photons)
	- Silver is a good reflector for visible light but kinda bad for other wavelengths
	- curved mirrors turn plane waves into spherical waves
