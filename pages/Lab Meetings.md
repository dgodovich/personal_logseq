	- copying over handwritten notes
	- Single cell variability in ERK activity
		- receptor expression, phosphatase expression, other proteins?
	- Nascent FISH to get foci of transcription of fos
		- very early gene transcribed after ERK activation
	- phospho ERK goes to nucleus -> off
	- ERK is on in the cytoplasm
	- PDGF mediated fos transcription is started by ERK
		- but it's not what determines how many cells with respond
	- p38 (MAPK14) is same level as ERK in the kinase cascade, it's a MAPK effector
	- CDKN1 (p21) is downstream of p53
		- involved in cell cycle arrest and cancer progression by turning off CDKs

	- Funny this is literally the same stuff I was working on
	- Encode spatial pattern with optogenetics
	- Drug plus light and gate
		- Can bathe in drug and still get specificity
	- I stopped taking notes because it got complicated and no one else was taking notes at all lol
		- Some interesting stuff with the patterning and difficulties with cloning pretty much
