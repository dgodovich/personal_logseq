- General considerations
  collapsed:: true
	- I want to be in at least a small city
		- i.e. I don't really want to be in something like Ithaca or Bing?
		- I did like Bing after some time, and I think I would like it more now, but for something like a PhD in which I will be at this school for ~6 years I would like it to be in a more interesting and developed location
	- I do not want to be in New York City, and probably not NYS as well
		- One exception to this is a [[Tri-I]]  school because of Kat's recommendation making it almost a safety
		- For NYS, I can make exceptions for something really far like Rochester or Buffalo, but I don't think there are school there that I want to apply for
		- This really extends out to the NYC metro area (which covers all of NYS)
			- e.g. I don't really want to be at Princeton because the city for Princeton is actually just New York. I have a pretty good understanding of what it would be like to live in Princeton
	- I will most likely be in a dev bio department because of my interests
		- It could be really anything ranging from dev bio to bioengineering and I can find that out once I get there
	- I want a program that has rotations
	- I should make a spreadsheet
	- How the hell do I actually narrow down to programs I want to apply to??
