- This year notes
	- Day 1
		- Julie Nadal presenting, she's the assistant dean for the graduate school
		  collapsed:: true
			- This is the same presentation as last year
			- NIH postbac, grad at Albert Einstein, has been at NYAS, Johns Hopkins, and now GSK
			- She thinks the metric for graduation is published research, which is a little different than what I thought it would be
				- Thesis is a combination of peer reviewed papers
			- PhD program structure
				- Year 1
					- Classes, rotations, select thesis lab
					- Sometimes you don't rotate, but I won't be doing that
					- Rotations
						- Short 5 - 10 week research experiences in labs led by PIs you are interested in
						- 1 - 3, up to 5 rotations
						- Sometimes concurrent with courses, sometimes separated depending on institute
							- GSK separates it, Weill Cornell does not
						- Mentorship from PI and usually a postdoc or phd student
				- Year 2
					- Some more classes but not always (program dependent)
						- GSK finishes in year 1
					- Some research
					- Qualifying exam, moving into candidacy
						- Combination of oral and written exam
				- Year 2 - 5
					- Do research
					- Teach if you want to or an available option
						- GSK does not? Probably?
						- Not much - teaching fellows
					- Skill development
				- Year 6
					- Finish and defend
			- Schools that offer phds
				- Large Universities - with undergrad program
					- i.e. Stanford, UNC, Johns Hopkins, etc
					- Many programs, teaching is readily available
				- Associated with a medical school
					- e.g. Mayo clinic, Albert Einstein, UT Southwestern
					- Medical focus, translational research
				- Stand Alone graduate schools
					- e.g. GSK, Scripps Research, St Judes
					- No medical school - some other affiliate
				- Partnerships
					- e.g. Salk, NIH, MD Anderson
					- institutes that have degrees from another university
			- Schools have a lot of phd programs that are related
				- some programs bridge graduate and medical schools
					- two schools, one program e.g. Harvard, UMich, UCRiverside
					- two schools, two programs - e.g. cornell, NYU med and grad, Penn
				- Johns hopkins is notoriously bad for this
			- Choosing a program
				- paradox of choice
				- how do you know what program is right for you
				- Identify the most important aspects of PhD programs
					- Research
						- Areas of expertise
							- Be fairly broad for this
						- Basic and/or translational
						- number of faculty
							- don't apply for just one faculty member, very risky
					- Location
					- structure
						- type of university
						- collaborations
						- rotation and course structure
						- expectations for graduation - publish, thesis, etc
					- money / resources
						- facilities, stipend, benefits, housing
						- research support important too
							- cores, university tech, microscopes, whatever
					- Class size - this seems not super important?
					- Community
						- You will be spending a lot of time here, so you should try to make sure that it's a good one
					- Do your best to maximize these for your specific needs
				- Use resources and advice from colleagues and mentors to narrow the list
				- Apply to a select group of schools
					- entirely up to you
					- consider scale, money you can spend, how hard is it to get in, what happens if you do not get in
				- How to find programs
					- AAMC, ABRCMS, Office of intramural training and education at nih
			- Caring for the science and the scientist
				- Medical/dental insurance
				- stipend
				- conference travel, relocation costs, subsidized housing
			- Funding mechanisms
				- Where is your stipend coming from?
				- individual fellowship
				- faculty money
				- graduate school
				- teaching
					- This could be conditional based on teaching
				- training grants
				- Questions to ask
					- Is it guaranteed? For how long?
					- Is is conditional on anything (teaching)?
					- Do you get a bonus for getting external funding like F31 or GRFP?
			- Development
				- Training for well rounded science
				- technical training
				- fellowship writing
				- career development
				- teaching
					- Do I want to try to get a certificate for this?
				- etc
			- Application process
				- Types of programs
					- Umbrella program
						- Apply, interview in umbrella program, accept to one program
						- Choose track in program
					- Designated track
						- e.g. GSK has cancer bio and cancer eng
						- All application is specific to that track, not the other one
				- Parts of application
					- fee - try to get fee waivers if I can at all? GSK is free
					- Online application - basically a CV
					- Personal statement - probably the most important part of the application
						- Why do you want to come to this school? Who are you?
					- 3x letter of rec - less generic the better (I gotta talk to Adela)
					- Official transcript
					- GRE is pretty much optional, you can send if you want (or if they let you)
			- What are grad programs looking for
				- Passion for science and research
				- Experience conducting research
				- Evidence you will succeed in curriculum
				- Commitment to pursuing a PhD
			- Q&A
				- don't be arrogant (confidence vs arrogance)
				- figuring out student happiness
					- it's all about talking to students
					- Happens mostly at interview or after acceptance, kind of hard to judge at application phase
					- Talk to people you know at that institute
						- How do they feel about the city? The program? their cohort?
						- Research support? Rotations?
		- admission committee Panel
		  collapsed:: true
			- What areas do you wish student would emphasize in their materials?
				- How do you think about science? Details are important but your thought process is more important
				- Where are you coming from, where are you going to?
				- Personal statement is about you as a scientist
					- Explain clearly about what you have done, what you want to do
					- Why are you interested in what you are
				- Don't sweep things under the rug, you can address is in your personal statement
				- Take first paragraph and last paragraph of statement and see if there's anything specific about you - there is no other person who could have put this statement together (in my nearby community)
				  background-color:: yellow
				- Experience showing that you have worked through adversity
				- This guy cannot emphasize enough how important the personal statement is
				- tailoring to the program
			- Everything in science (life) is a story - you need to tell the story of yourself (as a scientist)
			- What part of the application are you harshest on?
				- Personal / scientific statement (duh)
			- mistakes
				- Need to have reflection about how you think in your statement
					- e.g. everyone has been affected by cancer, but how has it impacted you is unique. That part needs to come through
				- extreme confidence or lack of
			- interview is the same as the rest of it - scientific story, where is that going, broader
				- tell me about the most exciting question you worked on
				- where is the field going in 5 years
				- know the research of the person interviewing you
				- figuring out if you actually did what you said you did
				- it's a conversation about your interests, what you want to do, take the field. forward looking thought is very valuable (scientists love that)
		- Interview tips and panel with current students
		  collapsed:: true
			- Opportunity for conversation about motivation and your story
			- Assess fit of program - you are also interviewing them
			- Probably interview with 5 - 8 faculty, many 1 on 1
			- Everything is in the context of science
			- Interview format
				- Mostly online now, but it depends on the program
				- GSK is online in January
				- Campus visit in March for accepted students
			- Campus visits
				- Pay attention to the environment
					- students
					- community
					- location
			- Review your application materials
			- Prepare questions for your interviewers in advance
			- STAR method
				- situation, task, action, result
			- PIs like to question the fundamentals of what you are doing - you have to know it very well
			- Tell me about something that wasn't on your application materials
			- Working on actual lab problems / questions - sounds fun
			- Fairly significant amount of time to prep for each interview
				- Especially if it's in person
				- Zoom interview you might not know
			- Professors that you mention in your application frequently show up in interviews
			- Need to be able to talk scientifically
			- Try to have as many questions as possible
				- Do you like it here?
				- How many students do you have? Trying to figure out their mentorship style
				- One thing Kat mentioned today was to pay attention to authorship from each student
					- Shyer rodrigues lab publishes very high but not every student gets a first author paper
	- Day 2
		- Program overviews 4 - 5pm, I skip. Should be the same as last year
			- Or if I do go, don't really pay attention
			- Weill cornell has in person interviews
			- If you have research experience, you need to be able to explain how it fits in to broader field and scientific progress
		- Personal statement
			- Also probably the same as last year but I think I want to hear it again
			- Assess your aptitude and prep for graduate work (from consuming to creating knowledge)
			- Personal statement is a trailer for the movie of the interview (and series of grad school)
			- Many people with different kinds of scientific backgrounds will read it
			- Must spend some amount of time to tailor to the specific program
				- Can have the same skeleton and some of the research
			- intro middle end
				- who are you, why do you want to go to grad school
				- research and the bulk
			- Dry and boring and just about science is fine, but some humor is fine
				-

	- Fellowships and Funding 9/14
		- NIH F31 or NSF GRFP are the biggest government PhD awards
		- Scientific foundation or professional society; HHMI
		- Internal awards
		- Also public charities/foundations, non-profits, NGO, Industry, etc
		- Can apply as primary contact (as the PI of the grant), or together with your advisor
		- High success rate >25%, can apply for multiple
		- PhD programs are still fully funded typically in the us
		- Applying before or year 1 is good for techs / postbac students - like me
		- NIH F31 is a standard fellowship after candidacy exam, so in 3rd year
		- For NSF GRFP:
			- Use current research project with some data and propose new aims
			- Ok if project changes, especially if applying before graduate school, it's ok to change labs in grad school
			- Demonstrate your ability to prepare a 3 year research proposal
			- Field is based on the research your are proposing
			- Proposal does not reflect the thesis research that you will be doing, it's more about showing how you prepare one - totally ok to do something completely different
		- For NIH F31:
			- Use thesis lab project and proposal
			- Should have publication or award or something, more substantial data
			- Needs convincing feasibility for at least 1 / 3-4 aims
		- Mention in personal statement if you are applying, also bring up in interviews
		- "I have submitted an NSF GRFP application, in which I indicated a sincere interest in
		  conducting thesis research in a phd program where I can do blah blah … I
		  proposed … I'm excited to do this research at …. In the labs of …."
		- Demonstrate that you know how to get funding  and ready to write a research proposal
		- Grants and fellowships offices at each institution. Pivot grant database access (MSK
		  access)
		- For GRFP, consider broad impact for STEM - teaching, etc. Can only apply once
		- Deadline is October 16 - 20
		- Do lit review (obviously), get preliminary data
		- Aims Section
			- Specific Aims page for NIH F31
			- Arial 11pt font 0.5 in margins
			- One page executive summary, WRITE THIS FIRST, serves as your outline. Send page to anyone who writes rec letter, because they're also gonna want to check it out
			- Has to have everything about your project. Must be concise, precise. Really critical
			- Study section is when grants are decided. 3 people get your grant to read fully, everyone else
			  only has one page. So its really really important
		- Intro paragraph 1/4 page
			- Opening sentence
			- Current knowledge and gaps, which needs to be filled
			- Statement of need
		- What/Why/Who paragraph
			- Long term goal, overall objective, central hypothesis
			- Keep narrowing funnel as you add information
		- Specifics (numbered)
			- Aims - 2 maybe 3 hypothesis
			- First should be airtight, second can be a bit more wishy washy. Should not depend on first
		- Payoff
			- 2 sentences, could be longer depending on how much you have above. Whitespace on the page is ok
			- Highlight deliverables, why it's imporant
			- Tie in to funding agency
		- Longer sections that address research strategy
			- NIH fellowship asks for 6 pages with 2 sections - significance, innovation
				- Signficance - why is your problem important, why are the effects of the solution?
					- ~1-1.5 page out of 6
					- Intro paragraph, scientific premise. Add in preliminary data if you have it
					- Summarize scientific premise with figures
					- Expected contributions to project
				- Innovation - methods, How will you do this
					- Consider relevant
					  biological variables
					- Anticipated results
					- Paragraph about obstacles,
					  alternative explationations
		- Reading fellowships starts at 100 and gets deductions
		- Importance: is research low impact? Is it not very significant or exciting?
		- 1000% make sure that you are not missing literature findings
		- Good controls, include alternative models
		- Other things for fellowship applications:
			- Project abstract summary  - summarize your research / career goals, succinct description.
				- Write this last
			- Project narrative / lay summary - read press releases from communications office for baseline
			- Biosketch - NIH CV up to 5 pages, right now probably around 1. Very specific for NIH
		- Personal statement
		- Positions / honors
		- Contributions to science
		- Additional info - undergrad / grad courses
		- They suggest to start 4 months in advance
		- Do I need to base the NSF-GRFP on my data or can I do it based on a literary review, pose a hypothesis and write/plan out an experimental design?
			- Ushma Neill       4:51 PM
				- Either one! If you’re planning to stay in the lab you’re in now, or one that is in an adjacent
				  topic, then yes- use data to demonstrate feasibility. otherwise, you can use
				  that data to show that YOU GOT THIS. you know how to do the kind of experiments
				  that are needed in your proposal
