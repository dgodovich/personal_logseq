- This year notes
	- Day 1
		- Julie Nadal presenting, she's the assistant dean for the graduate school
		- NIH postbac, grad at Albert Einstein, has been at NYAS, Johns Hopkins, and now GSK
		- She thinks the metric for graduation is published research, which is a little different than what I thought it would be
			- Thesis is a combination of peer reviewed papers
		- PhD program structure
		  collapsed:: true

		- Mostly information I already know
		- Types of schools that offer phds
			- Large unversities, eg stanford, unc, etc etc
			- Medical school, e.g. mayo clinic, ut southwestern
			- Stand alone graduate schools, e.g. GSK, Scripps research, St Judes, Rockefeller, CSHL
			- Partnerships, e.g. Salk institute, NIH, MD Anderson
				- Research organizations that do not have their own graduate schools
				- Like Salk is at UC San Diego, so you can work in their labs but degree is from somewhere else
				- NIH is with Hopkins, Georgetown, other nearby places
		- Some universities have multiple programs to apply to
			- Multiple schools in one program
				- Medical and graduate school share a phd program
				- Harvard, Umich, UC Riverside
			- Two schools, two programs.
				- Separated Medical school and graduate school applications
				- Weill Cornell Medical vs Cornell Ithaca
				- NYU medical vs NYU Graduate school
				- Upenn medical vs Upenn graduate school
		- Identify important aspects of phd programs, get resources and advice from mentors and colleagues to narrow the list down
		- Apply to 5 - 10 programs, good to be strategic about it
		- Factors to consider
			- Research
				- Areas of expertise
				- Basic vs translational
				- Number of faculty working in
				   area you're interested in
			- Location
				- City vs rural, close to
				   family. Hub of biomedical science
				- Culture, entertainment,
				   diversity, etc etc
			- Structure
				- Type of university as listed above, that matters a lot
			- Collaboration opportunities
			- Expectations for graduation
			- Course structure
			- Resources
				- Science and stipend/benefits
				   and other things
				- Housing
				- Level of funding
			- Class size
			- Community
				- Program leadership access
				- Relationship with faculty
		- How do you find graduate programs
			- AAMC, ABRCMS (big conference), Grad career fair at NIH
		- Funding needs to care for the science and the scientist - stipend, relocation benefit, conferece travel, awards
			- Subsidized housing, insurance, cost of living
		- Funding mechanisms
			- Individual fellowships, Training Grants, faculty grants, graduate school itself, teaching, other
		- Questions to ask about stipends
			- Is it guaranteed and for how long?
			- Is teaching required, for how long, how much do you get paid?
			- Do you get a bonus for getting individual fellowships
			- What happens if you come in with NSF GRFP? Or other
		- Offering technical writing courses, fellowship writing support, DEI, etc
		- Apply in the same way as college - reach, target, safety
		- Types of phd programs
			- Umbrella programs have many tracks for one application, other programs have track upfront
		- Online application replaces CV sometimes. Typically two to three rec letters from Pis if possible.
			- GRE mostly optional

			- Cancer Biology / Cancer Engineering program - I would be more interested in cancer engineering
			  (like with Huangfu)
			- Average 6 year program
			- 10-12 class size, very many mentors available, that do teach you
		- Weill Cornell
			- BCMB - Cell, structural, dev, molecular biology, biochem
			- Also programs in pharma, immunology, physiology, many more
			- Larger program - 60-70 students, each program is a bit smaller, 10-20
			- 164 faculty at Sloan Kettering, 429 at Weill Cornell / HSS, 60 research areas
			- Defense average 5.8 years, coursework can be up to 2 years but focused in year one
			- Can work with faculty members in any program
			- Guaranteed stipend, no TA requirement. Students have health insurance. Guaranteed affordable housing
		- Computational Biology and Medicine program
			- Tri- I, so in all SKI, Weill Cornell, and Rockefeller
			- A bit faster graduation 5.5 years, average 4+ publications
			- Program is computational but can pursue combination projects
			- 17 MSK faculty, 11 Rockefeller faculty, 23 Weill cornell, 11 Cornell ithaca
			- Interview decisions are made about 2 weeks after, very quickly

			- Individual faculty read 20 - 60 applications, deans 400-1000, goal is to get an interview
			- Short essay 500-1000 words that introduces your personal reasons, experiences, and interest in particular program. Schools can have specific prompts that you have to answer
			- Appropriate to mention faculty members you are interested in in the personal statement
			- Focus on presenting research experiences, both big picture and your contribution, and how skills have prepared your for the next steps
			- Try to make your unrelated experiences cohesive
			- Where do you start
			  writing
				- Think about aspirations, goals, story, challenges, strengths, weaknesses
				- Capture all ideas first, start early. Edit later
				- Potentially address covid impact?
			- Putting experiences from your resume use statement to reflect impact on you, not others
				- Resume/CV has numbers info and outcomes
				- Statement has why does this matter for you, what did you think about it
					- ICK! Impacted x kids, whatever is for resume
					- But I was impacted by seeing the magic that children experiencing science for the first time blah blah blah
			- Talk to people about it! Especially check admissions committee people (i.e. Kat)
			- Will be read by 20 - 50 people, so don't be shy
			- Really really really edit grammar
			- Gotta address the prompts
			- Include yourself, but it is always about research at the end of the day
	- Fellowships and Funding 9/14
	  collapsed:: true
		- NIH F31 or NSF GRFP are the biggest government PhD awards
		- Scientific foundation or professional society; HHMI
		- Internal awards
		- Also public charities/foundations, non-profits, NGO, Industry, etc
		- Can apply as primary contact (as the PI of the grant), or together with your advisor
		- High success rate >25%, can apply for multiple
		- PhD programs are still fully funded typically in the us
		- Applying before or year 1 is good for techs / postbac students - like me
		- NIH F31 is a standard fellowship after candidacy exam, so in 3rd year
		- For NSF GRFP:
			- Use current research project with some data and propose new aims
			- Ok if project changes, especially if applying before graduate school, it's ok to change labs in grad school
			- Demonstrate your ability to prepare a 3 year research proposal
			- Field is based on the research your are proposing
			- Proposal does not reflect the thesis research that you will be doing, it's more about showing how you prepare one - totally ok to do something completely different
		- For NIH F31:
			- Use thesis lab project and proposal
			- Should have publication or award or something, more substantial data
			- Needs convincing feasibility for at least 1 / 3-4 aims
		- Mention in personal statement if you are applying, also bring up in interviews
		- "I have submitted an NSF GRFP application, in which I indicated a sincere interest in
		  conducting thesis research in a phd program where I can do blah blah … I
		  proposed … I'm excited to do this research at …. In the labs of …."
		- Demonstrate that you know how to get funding  and ready to write a research proposal
		- Grants and fellowships offices at each institution. Pivot grant database access (MSK
		  access)
		- For GRFP, consider broad impact for STEM - teaching, etc. Can only apply once
		- Deadline is October 16 - 20
		- Do lit review (obviously), get preliminary data
		- Aims Section
			- Specific Aims page for NIH F31
			- Arial 11pt font 0.5 in margins
			- One page executive summary, WRITE THIS FIRST, serves as your outline. Send page to anyone who writes rec letter, because they're also gonna want to check it out
			- Has to have everything about your project. Must be concise, precise. Really critical
			- Study section is when grants are decided. 3 people get your grant to read fully, everyone else
			  only has one page. So its really really important
		- Intro paragraph 1/4 page
			- Opening sentence
			- Current knowledge and gaps, which needs to be filled
			- Statement of need
		- What/Why/Who paragraph
			- Long term goal, overall objective, central hypothesis
			- Keep narrowing funnel as you add information
		- Specifics (numbered)
			- Aims - 2 maybe 3 hypothesis
			- First should be airtight, second can be a bit more wishy washy. Should not depend on first
		- Payoff
			- 2 sentences, could be longer depending on how much you have above. Whitespace on the page is ok
			- Highlight deliverables, why it's imporant
			- Tie in to funding agency
		- Longer sections that address research strategy
			- NIH fellowship asks for 6 pages with 2 sections - significance, innovation
				- Signficance - why is your problem important, why are the effects of the solution?
					- ~1-1.5 page out of 6
					- Intro paragraph, scientific premise. Add in preliminary data if you have it
					- Summarize scientific premise with figures
					- Expected contributions to project
				- Innovation - methods, How will you do this
					- Consider relevant
					  biological variables
					- Anticipated results
					- Paragraph about obstacles,
					  alternative explationations
		- Reading fellowships starts at 100 and gets deductions
		- Importance: is research low impact? Is it not very significant or exciting?
		- 1000% make sure that you are not missing literature findings
		- Good controls, include alternative models
		- Other things for fellowship applications:
			- Project abstract summary  - summarize your research / career goals, succinct description.
				- Write this last
			- Project narrative / lay summary - read press releases from communications office for baseline
			- Biosketch - NIH CV up to 5 pages, right now probably around 1. Very specific for NIH
		- Personal statement
		- Positions / honors
		- Contributions to science
		- Additional info - undergrad / grad courses
		- They suggest to start 4 months in advance
		- Do I need to base the NSF-GRFP on my data or can I do it based on a literary review, pose a hypothesis and write/plan out an experimental design?
			- Ushma Neill       4:51 PM
				- Either one! If you’re planning to stay in the lab you’re in now, or one that is in an adjacent
				  topic, then yes- use data to demonstrate feasibility. otherwise, you can use
				  that data to show that YOU GOT THIS. you know how to do the kind of experiments
				  that are needed in your proposal
