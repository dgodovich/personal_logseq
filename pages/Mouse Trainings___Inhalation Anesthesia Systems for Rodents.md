- It is important to use the lowest possible dose required to achieve a proper plane of anesthesia
- in combination with oxygen as the carrier gas, from an oxygen concentrator
- Planes of anesthesia

- endotracheal intubation, anesthesia may be induced with a combination of a preanesthetic (e.g., xylazine) and a short-term injectable anesthetic (e.g., ketamine/midazolam) or solely with an inhalant anesthetic
- faster rate of anesthetic induction caused by the other gas is known as the second gas effect
- agent that is water-soluble will dissolve to a high concentration in the blood
- agent that is fat-soluble quickly reaches saturation

- flow meter adjusts the ~50 psi into a flow measured in liters per minute (L/min)
- precision vaporizer that delivers a controlled anesthetic concentration in a carrier gas
- isoflurane can be stored in the vaporizer for extended periods of time
- It makes no difference in a non-rebreathing anesthesia system where the oxygen flow meter is set, whether it is 0.5 liter per minute or 4 liters per minute; the resultant gas flow will be 97.5% oxygen and 2.5% isoflurane
- face mask should be sized to fit snugly over the nose
- gas exhaled by the animal is immediately diverted
- active scavenging system uses negative pressure
- passive scavenging system uses the positive pressure of the gas stored in the cylinder (the same pressure that has created the entire system flow) to carry the waste gas away
- Do not use the flush valve when the animal is connected to the non-rebreathing circuit
- heat should be maintained during all procedures lasting longer than 1 minute
