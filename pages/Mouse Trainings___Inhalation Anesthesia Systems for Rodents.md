- endotracheal intubation, anesthesia may be induced with a combination of a preanesthetic (e.g., xylazine) and a short-term injectable anesthetic (e.g., ketamine/midazolam) or solely with an inhalant anesthetic
- faster rate of anesthetic induction caused by the other gas is known as the second gas effect
- agent that is water-soluble will dissolve to a high concentration in the blood
- agent that is fat-soluble quickly reaches saturation
