	- Aims
		- Specific Aim 1: Determine if TRP4 Ca²⁺ channels have different forms between 26°C to 31°C.
		- Specific Aim 2: Show if pSTAT3 positively regulates itself to commit to female development.
	- Background notes
		- Low temperatures (male) (26C) Kdm6b is upregulated
			- this is a demethylase, so repressive Me marks are removed from cells
			- Specifically results in an increase of Dmrt1 expression, specifies male gonads
		- Kdm6b is repressed at female temperatures by STAT3 signaling
			- Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) cals
