- Primary Reviewer for Grant 12 (5 minute limit)
	- You will provide a brief summary of the grant proposal. Mention the subject, the approach, and the significance. You should be able to get all the information from the grant.
	- List the greatest strength of the proposal and the biggest weakness (only 1 of each is needed and you can find that the grant is lacking strength or weakness). You will announce these in class.
	- Announce your score for the grant.
	- Aims
		- Specific Aim 1: Determine if TRP4 Ca²⁺ channels have different forms between 26°C to 31°C.
		- Specific Aim 2: Show if pSTAT3 positively regulates itself to commit to female development.
	- Background notes
		- Low temperatures (male) (26C) Kdm6b is upregulated
			- this is a demethylase, so repressive Me marks are removed from cells
			- Specifically results in an increase of Dmrt1 expression, specifies male gonads
		- Kdm6b is repressed at female temperatures by STAT3 signaling
			- Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) calcium cation channels mediate this
			- pSTAT3 is important for repression
		- Increasing pSTAT3 leads to female regardless of temp
			- likewise, decreasing leads to male regardless of temp
		- There's a specific window of sensitivity
			- stages 15-20, irreversible after 20
			- If you pulse high temp at this time you get the pulsed one, not the normal one
		- Thoughts about the background
			- There's a bunch of information missing here
				- What's up with the staging? How long is turtle development? Is 4h actually quick?
			- Why are you focusing on TRP4 specifically?
			- Health relevance?
	- Aim 1: Determine if TRP4 Ca²⁺ channels have different forms between 26°C to 31°C.
		- The system requires a cellular component able to broadcast either two different signals at 26°C vs 31°C or offer no signal at all at one temperature
			- this is a claim, there's other ways to do this? Why couldn't you have a gradient?
		- Microscale thermophoresis (MST) for binding affinities at specific temperatures
		- also cryoEM that I'm not sure will work
		- Also look into alternative splicing
			- affinity tag chromatography for specific exons? can you do this?
			- I feel like it's gotta be sequencing right?
		- cool technique for RNA secondary structure, SHAPE-MaP
	- Aim 2: show if pSTAT3 positively regulates itself to commit to female development
		- treat with different levels of calcium to activate pSTAT3
		- get Hill coefficient
	- Summary
		- Turtles have temperature dependent sex determination
		- TRP calcium channels could have a temperature dependence, or maybe there's an RNA component
		- Strength:
			- Grant addresses various possibilities of temperature dependence and offers overlapping experiments to fully characterize
		- Weakness:
			- No health relevance
		- Score:
			- 5
- Secondary Reviewer for Grant 10  (3 minute limit)
	- You will add anything you think the Primary reviewer didn’t highlight that is important for scoring purposes.
	- List the greatest strength and biggest weakness from your analysis (only 1 of each is needed). You will announce these in class.
	- Announce your score for the grant.
	- This is a real tough one to read
		- The abstract and background felt good and aim 1 is immediately into like goddamn what is going on
	- Strength
		- very thorough
	- Weakness
	  id:: 68e73230-fed3-4020-9ed6-43583dc8a310
		- aim 2 doesn't have alternative experiments
	- Score
		- 2
-
- why -> how -> so what
	- need the why and the so what
	- Have to get through the how very well, but it's not the critical part
- Don't want to have incremental progress, want big questions
	- important to avoid bias by saying you're proving something or it's a small knowledge gap
	- Better to launch into a new thing
- Predict something happening but without being prescriptivist

- notes on my grant
	- better controls
	  background-color:: yellow
		- optogenetics in MDCK cells as control
	- RPPA - blind spots in the array design
		- try to overcome the blind spot by checking the protein list
	- aim 1 is too broad, specifying are better
	- list what outcomes are expected
		- sentence or two at end to summarize aims
	- reader doesn't necessarily know what's going on
		- rationale of which cell line is used
	- confusing to follow
	- very methods heavy not enough so what
		- put this into the aims to keep segueing consistently
