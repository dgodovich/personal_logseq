- **Title:**
- **Aim 1: in vitro optimization of RTK platform for targeted migration**
	- this is built off of my 504 minigrant
- **Aim 2: in vivo performance testing with LNP delivery systems in a mouse skin healing model**
	- Maybe would be good to talk to Deepika about this again?
	- Mentioning Danelle (and Kai?) here for sure
		- that supports the merit criteria that they like to see of how I will be using Princeton specific resources
-
- Intellectual Merit
	- I think leveraging collaborations in my department is pretty good to talk about here?
	- Some kind of summary of the above research plan?
- Broader Impacts
	- Wound healing is epic
	- Cresilon I think would be good to mention here, especially given that I will be getting a rec from Adela
	- [ARIS from Rutgers for citations for broader impacts, might be nice to have one or two?](https://aris.marine.rutgers.edu/)
