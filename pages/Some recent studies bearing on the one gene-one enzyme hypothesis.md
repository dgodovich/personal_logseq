- Notes below
- Intro
	- Assumption that a given gene is involved in the production of a single enzyme
	- Beadle and Tatum 1941 paper mentioned won them the nobel for genes
	- Gene whose sole activity aside from self-duplication (lol) is that of functioning in the synthesis of a particular enzyme or enzyme precursor
		- Not implied that other genes can't function in the formation of that protein
		- Basically if two genes come together into a protein, they must be different things
		- Phenotype also is not directly caused, because it's integrated
	- Things that can't produce an AA are bad, but can be fixed by supplying the AA
		- But the gene doesn't make the AA, it makes a protein that is one step in the pathway to the AA
	- There's residual effects from supplementation
		- sterility, lowered growth, sterility in crosses, etc
		- Probably caused by build up of metabolites
- The Selection Problem
	- Mutants that can't grow on complete media have lost *indispensable function*
		- Require a substance not present in complete media
		- Require a substance that can't diffuse into the cell
		- Require a substance that can't be used because of some inhibitor present
	- Delbruck suggests that any gene with more than one function would likely have an indispensable function and then not be able to be detected
	- This depends on the relative frequency of indispensable functions
		- Assume that some genes have multiple functions:
		- If high frequency, then finding a mutation that has two primary functions would be very hard
		- If low, then it should be possible
- The Frequency of Indispensable Functions in Neurospora
	- Temperature mutants have some mutation which only applies in a specific temperature range
	- Generally, require a growth factor at 35 deg, but not at 25 deg
		- Some cases this is reversed
	- Mutant should be recoverable in the temperature range at which it doesn't need supplementation
		- Doesn't matter what the function that was lost was
	- This is true because about half of the mutants can't grow in complete media in their temperature range
		- some indispensable function was lost and can't be supplemented
	- should have a random distribution of indispensable and dispensable functions in temperature alleles
