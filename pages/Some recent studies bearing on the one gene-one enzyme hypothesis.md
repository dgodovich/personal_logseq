- Notes below
- Intro
	- Assumption that a given gene is involved in the production of a single enzyme
	- Beadle and Tatum 1941 paper mentioned won them the nobel for genes
	- Gene whose sole activity aside from self-duplication (lol) is that of functioning in the synthesis of a particular enzyme or enzyme precursor
		- Not implied that other genes can't function in the formation of that protein
		- Basically if two genes come together into a protein, they must be different things
		- Phenotype also is not directly caused, because it's integrated
	- Things that can't produce an AA are bad, but can be fixed by supplying the AA
		- But the gene doesn't make the AA, it makes a protein that is one step in the pathway to the AA
	- There's residual effects from supplementation
		- sterility, lowered growth, sterility in crosses, etc
		- Probably caused by build up of metabolites
- The Selection Problem
	- Mutants that can't grow on complete media have lost *indispensable function*
		- Require a substance not present in complete media
