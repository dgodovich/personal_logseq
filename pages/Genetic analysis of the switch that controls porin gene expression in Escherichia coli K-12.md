- [[Abstract]]
	- The two-component regulatory system, OmpR and EnvZ, in Escherichia coli controls the differential expression of ompF and ompC in response to medium osmolarity. Previous studies suggest that EnvZ functions as a membrane sensor relaying information to the DNA-binding protein, OmpR, which in turn activates expression of the appropriate promoter. A strategy has been devised to isolate and characterize a collection of missense mutations in ompR that alter, but do not abolish protein function. Mutants were isolated using strains that contain the ompR and envZ genes in separate chromosomal locations yet maintain the production of both regulatory proteins at physiological levels. Such an arrangement facilitates ompR diploid analysis and tests of epistasis with known envZ mutations. The data obtained indicate that OmpR works in both a positive and negative fashion to control the transcription of ompF and this result forms the basis of a model for porin regulation that explains the switch from OmpF to OmpC production in response to increasing medium osmolarity.

	- ompF and C are the major outer membrane proteins
	- these are regulated at the transcriptional level by ompR and EnvZ
		- products of the *ompB* operon
	- OmpR is DNA binding to the promoters of ompF and ompC
	- EnvZ is thought to be a sensor whos readout is ompR activity
		- sensing membrane osmolarity
	- Two component regulatory system
		- sensor (EnvZ) and effector (OmpR)
	- OmpF and C are mutually exclusive
- ((68e85e28-46ed-4b8b-bb79-6a8ee29ac72c))
	- they use a \lambda derivative as a generalized transducing phage
	- and a helper phage G216 to get it into the genome
		- because the \lambda\RT2 is *int*
			- integrase negative
			- helper phage provides this in trans
	- merodiploids are RecA- so that they don't recombine again and kick anything out
	- mutagenize with nitrosoguanidine

	- OmpR was thought to have multiple forms that activate either ompF or ompC
		- look for mutants that can do one of these but not both
			- screen for mutants that lower expression of one of the omps
		- so looking for a missense mutation that reduces specific binding activity?
	- They use strains that have diploid ompB operon
		- but each copy only has one of ompR or envZ working
		- Tn10 insertion into envZ in the normal chromosome
		- non-polar deletion in ompR on the phage copy
	- This is a powerful strategy to work with two very closely linked genes
	- ompC lacZ fusion
		- dude these fusions are crazy
	- ompF specific phage sensitivity defines OmpF+
