- ce the bacteria are observed only after mixing is complete, they will respond as if they are in a uniform environment if they utilize instantaneous spatial sensing, whereas they will respond as if they are in a gradient if they utilize temporal gradient sensing, provided the mixing time is short compared to their time-dependent respon
