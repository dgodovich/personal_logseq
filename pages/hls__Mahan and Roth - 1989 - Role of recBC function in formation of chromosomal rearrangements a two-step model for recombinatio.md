- Such fully reciprocal exchanges result in His+recombinants that are associated with loss of his sequences at the donor site (ara).Circles generated by half-reciprocal recombination must integrate into the his region of an uninvolved sister chromosome. Such half-reciprocal exchanges result in Hisf recombinants that retain his sequences at the donor site

- (1) The frequency of recombination between direct repeats to remove anintervening segmentfrom the chromosome is not affected by the recBC function. This result confirms an earlier observation of SCLAFANIand WECHSLER(198 1) that the segregationof a duplication is independent of recBC function (2). The overall process of excising a circle and recapturing it at a distant site is stimulated by recBC function. (3) Inversion formation by recombination between inverse order homologies is stimulated by recBC function
