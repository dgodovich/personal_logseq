- Graduate only which is a downside for teaching, but maybe you can TA early grad courses later on
- Can only apply to one (1) UCSF graduate program per year
	- So can't do dev bio and bioengineering I think
- [Main website](https://graduate.ucsf.edu/)
	- [dev bio](https://dscb.ucsf.edu/)
	- [dev bio admissions page](https://dscb.ucsf.edu/admissions)
- [Stats](https://graduate.ucsf.edu/admission/graduate-program-statistics/phd-program-statistics)
	- [dev bio specific tables](https://graduate.ucsf.edu/admission/graduate-program-statistics/phd-program-statistics/program-stats-dscb)
	- This is probably the most selective program I'm applying to, it's 10% or less acceptance rate
