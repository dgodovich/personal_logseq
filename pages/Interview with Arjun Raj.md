- Really important to identify your strengths
- What kind of scientist are you? Identify what you're passionate about and what motivates you
	- What do you like to do every day?

	- 3 types of scientists
		- gearhead - method focused, making new method
		- analysts - working with data

	- Know what bucket you're in and accept that as early as possible
	- 50-75% of day could be doing something you like doing
	- Unstructured environment of grad school can be difficult to motivate on something you are
