- Arjun Raj at Penn responded to me asking for mentoring so I'm having a call with him
- Extremely early in the morning so forgive any typos I might make

- Really important to identify your strengths
- What kind of scientist are you? Identify what you're passionate about and what motivates you
	- What do you like to do every day?
		- i.e. I want to play tetris
	- 3 types of scientists
		- gearhead - method focused, making new method
		- analysts - working with data
		- dreamers - ideas
	- Know what bucket you're in and accept that as early as possible
	- 50-75% of day could be doing something you like doing
	- Unstructured environment of grad school can be difficult to motivate on something you are
- yale, penn, berkeley, stanford
- Computeatoin people feel frustrated with pace of experiments because it's so much slower
	- they have intentions of working in the lab but then it ends up being very painful
	- Satisfaction you can get from experimental results
	- Try to do experiments all in one big batch which does not go well
- Error rate
	- Experimental work in molecular biology requires being able to string together many things
	- "Good hands" - where does this happen? intuition, experience
	- Fundamental limiter is your error rate (multitasking ability)
	- The best experimentalist have a compulsion to do things the right way
	- hard to diagnose
