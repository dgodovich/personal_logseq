- [[Abstract]]
	- Osmoregulation of the bacterial porin genes ompF and ompC is controlled by a two-component regulatory system. EnvZ, the sensor component of this system, is capable both of phosphorylating and dephosphorylating OmpR, the effector component. Mutations were isolated in envZ that abolish the expression of both porin genes. These mutants appear to have lost the kinase activity of EnvZ while retaining their phosphatase activity, so that in their presence OmpR is completely unphosphorylated. The behavior of these mutants in haploid, and in diploid with other envZ alleles, is consistent with a model in which EnvZ mediates osmoregulation by controlling the concentration of a single species. OmpR-P.

	- [PubMed entry](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1660927)
- ompF and C are porins
- total amount is consistent, but individual concentration changes
- EnvZ (sensor) stimulus probably comes from the membrane or periplasm, not cytoplasm
	- OmpR is downstream effector in the cytoplasm
- model has low osmolarity OmpR binding to an activator at omfF
- high osmolarity OmpR binds to activator at ompC and repressor at F
- same phage sensitivity test as last time
- This is a very similar paper it seems, they're just doing it for EnvZ mutants insead of OmpR
- 6 hits that are not EnvZ null but are completely non functional
