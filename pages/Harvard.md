- Program Information:
	- There's the stem cell institute, the medical school, and harvard itself
		- Pretty sure you can apply to all of them together, but they have their own websites and stuff
	- Stem Cell institute does not have a direct application, you apply to one of the 14 Life Sciences programs at Harvard GSAS (graduate school of arts and sciences) and then you can work in a Stem Cell and Regenerative medicine lab
	- Programs to think about:
		- BBS - basic biological sciences
			- This is the umbrella program which has like 800 labs or something insane like that
			- Very large program, so many people (students and faculty), but you get access to everything at Harvard (and some at MIT too I think)
		- MCB - Molecular and cell biology
			- Smaller program, some restriction on what you can do
				- I think you can still work with basically any faculty member though? I could be wrong but it doesn't seem like you're limited to the ones hosted in the department
			- Smaller program in a big school feels like a better fit for me than the gigantic one
				- I feel like I want a close knit cohort? That seems like something I would enjoy
			- I will go here
- Faculty:
	- Labs
		- [Whited Lab](https://www.whitedlab.com/)
			- Axolotl regeneration lab that looked cool
			- Mildly concerning that there are very few students who graduated? But there are some there now
			- One of the students here did her undergrad at Berkeley and worked with Richard Harland there
- Writing Prompts:
	- Describe your reasons and motivations for pursuing a PhD in molecular and cellular biology, noting experiences that shaped your research ambitions as well as briefly indicating your scientific and career objectives. Your statement should not exceed 1,000 words.
- Other application notes:
	- [[GRE]] not accepted!
	- HILS program - can apply to multiple on one application I think, so do both MCB and BBS?
