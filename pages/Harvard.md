- Program Information:
  collapsed:: true
	- There's the stem cell institute, the medical school, and harvard itself
		- Pretty sure you can apply to all of them together, but they have their own websites and stuff
	- Stem Cell institute does not have a direct application, you apply to one of the 14 Life Sciences programs at Harvard GSAS (graduate school of arts and sciences) and then you can work in a Stem Cell and Regenerative medicine lab
	- Programs to think about:
		- BBS - basic biological sciences
			- This is the umbrella program which has like 800 labs or something insane like that
			- Very large program, so many people (students and faculty), but you get access to everything at Harvard (and some at MIT too I think)
		- MCB - Molecular and cell biology
			- Smaller program, some restriction on what you can do
				- I think you can still work with basically any faculty member though? I could be wrong but it doesn't seem like you're limited to the ones hosted in the department
			- Smaller program in a big school feels like a better fit for me than the gigantic one
				- I feel like I want a close knit cohort? That seems like something I would enjoy
			- I will go here

	- Harvard has too many things
		- [Stem cell institute](https://hsci.harvard.edu/home)
		- [Developmental and Regenerative Biology Department](https://drb.hms.harvard.edu/)
		- [Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology](https://hscrb.harvard.edu/)
			- what is the difference?? HSCRB vs DRB
			- seems like DRB is the school of HSCRB but is not one that you apply to, confusion
