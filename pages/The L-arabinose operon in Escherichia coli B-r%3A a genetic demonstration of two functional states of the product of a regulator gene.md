- [[Abstract]]
	- The product of the regulator gene araC in the L-arabinose gene complex exists in two functional states: P1, the repressor, and P2, the activator, presumably in equilibrium with each other, and with P1 and P2 attached to their respective controlling sites, araO, the operator, and araI, the initiator. The controlling sites are linked in the following order with respect to genes araB and araC: BIOC. Two C gene deletions (Delta719 and Delta766) serve to define the newly described araO site, and to place it adjacent to the left end of the C gene. We have suggested that deletion 719 deletes, in addition to the C gene, part or all of the araO site. Deletion 766 leaves the araO site intact. Complementation analysis employing stable merodiploids indicates that the repressor-operator site function is epistatic over the activator-initiator site function. It is necessary both for activator (P2) to be present and for repressor (P1) to be absent at their respective controlling sites (araI and araO) for full expression of the L-arabinose operon.

	- [PubMed entry](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4894687)
- This paper introduces the idea of positive control as an alternative to negative control
	- but this didn't really catch on at the time bc everyone thought that everything is negative control
- epistasis - effect of one gene is masked by the effect of another
- Arabinose complex has araD, araA, araB protein coding genes; araI initiator; and araC regulatory gene
	- araE is an unlinked gene that does active transport of arabinose
- They suggest that araC works as a positive regulator
- ((68d5cef7-b3d6-4dec-989e-1cefdd87e1a0))
	- They can produce a mutant that's pleiotropic negative and recessive in cis and trans to wt and constitutive
		- pleiotropic negative C- mutant means that ???
			- can't make any of the products on the control of the promoter? like no araD/A/B?
	- revertants can form a thermolabile gene product
		- implies that C is a protein product
	- They talk a bit about mapping it after this
		- direction of polarity is BAD
		- it's not part of the BAD operon
		- Initiator constitutive mutants I_c map to between B and C
			- I_c is low constitutive and cis dominant
- I_c mutants were isolated as revertants of Ara- deletion \Delta719
	- deletes the whole regulator gene araC
- this is a very confusing introduction
- Product of araC is an allosteric protein P1 that gets turned into the activator P2 by interaction with an inducer
	- this is indicated by dominance of C+ to C_c
		- competitive binding?
		- yep that's what they say in the next sentence
- Use \Delta766 which maps into araC to complement
- P2 binds to araI, P1 binds to araO (operator)
- ((68d5d45c-0393-49ae-9e7d-c6e5d1b64b23))
	- \Delta766 strain is also streptomycin resistant
	- Use phage P1bt to do generalized transduction
	- I_c mutants grow slowly on arabinose agar
	- Bunch of other stuff about how they do the crosses and measure growth
- ((68d5d5a3-a252-48b6-bbc1-1bd29ac0594e))
	- could be useful to reference
- ((68d5d6e1-18f0-4a20-829a-2b2f246b34a3))
	- map of region
- ((68d5d57b-fb0d-497a-b90d-1b17afae0894))
	- expression of araA cis to \Delta719 causes a constitutive increase in activity
		- in diploids containing A-C+ in the exogenote (plasmid)
		- compared to F- deletion or A-C- plasmid
	- ((68d5d684-2729-46f9-86f6-7ef5ebe14520))
		- Tom says that this is the key experimental finding
		- The endogenote strains are both A+I+ but have no C gene
			- \Delta719 can be I+ because the deletion doesn't get into araI, but covers araC and araO
			- \Delta766 just goes in araC
				- both have no functional C protein and therefore have no nothing
					- no repression and also no activation
		- C+ allele in the plasmid is cytoplasmic active and dominant in trans
			- both exogenotes are A-! all araA functionality is coming from the C- chromosome
			  background-color:: yellow
		- C- plasmid can't restore function
		- \Delta766 has not quite as strong of an effect but there is still something
			- is there something?
			- This might be because it's partially able to bind?
			- Oh it's because C product P1 can bind to the operator and it has to be induced to get activation into P2 and then bind to araI
				- \Delta719 has no operator so you can't get repression, you only get the activation component
