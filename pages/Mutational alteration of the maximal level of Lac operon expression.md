- O_o mutations are actually just extreme polar mutations, have nothing to do with the operator
- operator is site with single functionality: sensitivity to the repressor
- Promoter probably also determines maximal rate of transcription
- Deletions that get into z from the left substantially reduce the level of expression of y and a
	- this suggests that there is a region between o and z, p, that determines transcription level
- They want to look for reduced mutants
	- I think they want a leaky lac- mutant so that you know that it's a promoter
		- selection?
	- Select for red colonies on lactose-tetrazolium agar
		- can have slightly different color but it's still red
- Promoter mutant characteristics
	- should be pleiotropic for all 3 enzymes
		- phenotypically z-y-
		- Mutant L1 makes about 2% of each z and y, a is too low to measure
		- L8 and L37 make 5-10%
		- all 3 give wt lac+ recombinants with a lac z+y- test
		- mutations transfer with lac region through Hfr strain
		- L1 grows very slowly on lactose
			- also can't be induced?
		- melibiose can be kinda brought in with lactase permease but is a weak inducer
			- but it's a lot better if it's induced with IPTG
			- revertants of L8 and 37 can be selected by mel+ character
	- cis dominance
		- should not effect anything in trans
		- second z- operon doesn't effect any of the mutants
		- z+ operon with any is totally normal -> cis dominance
	- distinction from i-o control
		- promoter shouldn't have any effect on the repression mechanism if it's a different locus
		- L1 is weird but L8 and 37 are normally inducible, but still can't make that much protein
		- revertants are all constitutive -> i-
			- but still don't make more protein!

	- Something is supposedly missing here
	- can any of these mutations complement each other?
