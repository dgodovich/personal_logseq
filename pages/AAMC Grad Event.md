- Make sure that you have a drive for scientific research, that your values/skills/interests align, and career goals match
	- Yes I have done this
- Check that programs have track record of getting to where you want to go career wise
- Breadth of science
	- Do I want umbrella program or departmental? I think they often end up being similar enough because of tons of crosslisting
- Support services are important, but I am mostly going to large institutes
- Climate and moral of the program
	- Try to access student happiness, will you fit in?
- Ideal timeline
	- Most programs have dropped GRE requirements, I have it if I need it
	- Double check that no one needs an official transcript for the application
	- Visits and interviews are Jan/Feb/March
	- April 15 is the final deadline
	- Respond to all offers
- Personal statement
	- Explain the data of your application, provide context and motivation
	- Every school has slightly different prompts and structure, important to follow that
	- Clear description of your research experience, primarily focusing on why you did it (lab and field)
	- Great to structure it to tell your story - connect the separate events into one cohesive thread
- Strong recommendation to apply early
	- I think this is a correlation not causation thing, the people who are organized and can get there stuff early are more likely to get in
	- Applying early doesn't get you in to graduate school, but maybe it makes you more like someone who does
- Choosing where to apply
	- If you're between two programs at a school and the faculty are pretty similar, look into
		- coursework
		- science around you (not just what you're interested in, more generally the department)
	- Try to find similarities between my top choices and the second list
