- Plasmid R1 is a large (100 kb), lowâ€“copy number plasmid with segregation machinery encoded by the par operon (6, 7). This operon is composed of three elements: parC, parR, and parM (6). parM encodes an actin-like protein that assembles into dynamically unstable filaments (8). parR encodes a protein that binds cooperatively to sequence repeats within parC, forming a complex that binds ParM filament

- ParM is distinguished from actin by three important properties: (i) rapid, rather than slow, spontaneous nucleation; (ii) symmetrical, bidirectional elongation rather than polarized growth; and (iii) dynamic instability [the tendency to switch spontaneously (11) between phases of steady elongation and rapid shortening] rather than steady-state treadmilling
