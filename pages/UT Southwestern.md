		- in Dallas
		- Umbrella program
		- Comp bio is in BME application
		- Everything else is in umbrella BBS (basic biomedical sciences)
			- Can apply to both and admissions committees are separated
			- Because I have interests in both I probably wouldn't have to change much
		- Lots of overlap between labs, cross-appointed faculty
		- BBS requires 2 rotations can do up to 4, can start in summer
			- 6-8 weeks
		- BME and comp bio has a rotation system that's similar
		- co-mentorship is common
		- joint labs are popular
- Faculty:
	- BME faculty I'm interested in
