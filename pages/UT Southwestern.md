- John Wallingford
- UT Southwestern
	- in Dallas
	- Umbrella program
	- Comp bio is in BME application
	- Everything else is in umbrella BBS (basic biomedical sciences)
		- Can apply to both and admissions committees are separated
		- Because I have interests in both I probably wouldn't have to change much
	- Lots of overlap between labs, cross-appointed faculty
	- BBS requires 2 rotations can do up to 4, can start in summer
		- 6-8 weeks
	- BME and comp bio has a rotation system that's similar
	- comentorship is common
	- joint labs are popular
- I probably apply to umbrella BBS program
	- BME faculty I'm interested in
