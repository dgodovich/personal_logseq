- z is \beta\-galactosidase, i is repressor
	- mutation in z you get no enzyme, mutation in i you get constitutive expression
- Introduction
	- Lactose metabolism requires two stepwise processes
		- permease to get it into the cell
		- galactosidase to hydrolyze into simple sugars
	- These are both inducible with i
		- mutations in i result in constitutive activation of the pathway
		- mutations in i always affect both enzymes
	- Recombination of zygotic E. coli (i.e. one that has a plasmid from conjugation) takes place 60-90 minutes after injection
- Materials and methods
	- They use a strain that is sensitive to streptomycin, methionine - , has early Lac on the F plasmid, and is a \lambda lysogen
	- Also get strains with mutations in z, i, y by UV mutagenesis
	- Used the blender technique to get the timing of mating
	- Looks like fairly standard crossings
- Genetic Structure of the Lac Region
	- all mutations in lactose pathway are closely linked
		- because they're all in the same operon
		- low frequency of recombination between z and y mutations
			- that means that they're close together
		- i also remains with z most of the time, but less so with y
			- not super clear at this point which side of z *i* is on
	- some mutants in Z can't make either Z or y , but aren't deletions
		- probably nonsense?
