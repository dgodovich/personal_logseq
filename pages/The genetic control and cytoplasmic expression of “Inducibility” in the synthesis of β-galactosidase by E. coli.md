- z is \beta\-galactosidase, i is repressor
	- mutation in z you get no enzyme, mutation in i you get constitutive expression
- Introduction
	- Lactose metabolism requires two stepwise processes
		- permease to get it into the cell
		- galactosidase to hydrolyze into simple sugars
	- These are both inducible with i
		- mutations in i result in constitutive activation of the pathway
		- mutations in i always affect both enzymes
	- Recombination of zygotic E. coli (i.e. one that has a plasmid from conjugation) takes place 60-90 minutes after injection
- Materials and methods
	- They use a strain that is sensitive to streptomycin, methionine - , has early Lac on the F plasmid, and is a \lambda lysogen
	- Also get strains with mutations in z, i, y by UV mutagenesis
	- Used the blender technique to get the timing of mating
	- Looks like fairly standard crossings
- Genetic Structure of the Lac Region
	- all mutations in lactose pathway are closely linked
		- because they're all in the same operon
		- low frequency of recombination between z and y mutations
			- that means that they're close together
		- i also remains with z most of the time, but less so with y
			- not super clear at this point which side of z *i* is on
	- some mutants in Z can't make either Z or y , but aren't deletions
		- probably nonsense?
- \beta-Galactosidase synthesis by Heteromerozygotes
	- Heteromerozygote is the E. coli bacteria ~60-90 minutes after conjugation in which the plasmid has a different allele than the chromosomal DNA and it has not yet recombined
	- Have to check that this kind of E. coli is able to synthesize the enzyme, and also that that isn't coming from cytosolic transfer from the donor
	- Use that cross that ensure that only zygotes can have z
		- ((68d07231-95a0-4d9b-83dd-af88014cfb42))
		- F- is z- and streptomycin resistant, F+ is z+ and streptomycin sensitive
			- i.e. male can make Z but can't grow, female can grow but can't make z
	- ((68d072b3-c288-41f7-b9dd-66dec09d3788))
		- Protein synthesis happens very quickly, right after z+ is able to be made
	- They check for cytosolic transfer by doing an auxotrophic cross
		- ((68d0736f-4d04-4d80-a5f4-71b07554d1b6))
		- these ones can't survive because the male doesn't transfer any sugar (or cytosol)
		- grow in maltose medium
	- All z mutants are in the same cistron (gene) because they don't make any when crossed as double recessive heterozygotes
		- All of them are recessive because they are taken over by z+ every time
	- If z and i are in the same gene they probably can't interact through the cytoplasm and must be in cis to interact
		- Heterozygote z+i+/z-i- would not constitutively express
		- This is not true! they can make protein!
	- Even in absence of inducer protein translation begins immediately in that cross
		- This is not caused by recombination
		- They do act through the cytosol (of the zygote)
	- inducible is the dominant allele (i+)
		- this is because there's no protein even after hours in the type C cross
			- ((68d076f5-830d-4d82-962b-6945ea979634))
- Discussion and Conclusions
	- i gene controls the synthesis of a product which prevents synthesis of the other proteins unless it is externally induced
	- This can theoretically be either an activator or a repressor and have similar functionality
		- there's a couple other examples of repression in the literature
	- ((68d07837-7464-45fb-a2b2-58ede5efff55))
		- Key points here
	- This also works the same for the cI repressor
		- immunity is expressed in the cytoplasm
