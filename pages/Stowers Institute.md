- This shit is tiny
	- [Retention and Placement stats](https://www.stowers.org/gradschool/our-grad-school/retention)
	- They admit like 5 students a year and the program has only been around for 12 years
	- Very small alumni network and really not that much of a student body
	- This is especially a consideration in Kansas City where there isn't as much to do
