- super short paper
- Gene for structure + gene for regulation
- Regulators have pleiotropic coordinated effect
	- govern several linked proteins
- Operator
	- should be adjacent to a group of genes and control their activity
	- sensitive to repressor produced by the regulator gene
- Mutation assumptions
	- Some would look like deletions and not be complemented by any of the downstream genes
	- If you can't interact with the regulator you would have constitutive expression of downstream
		- should be dominant, but only in cis
			- same chromosome
		- inactivation of repressor is recessive
- diploid i+z-/F-i+z+ they isolate constitutive mutants o_c
- ((68d34c2f-c006-418f-abef-3b0eb6b0cccf))
	- they use F-lac plasmid rather than transient diploid
	- z1- and z4- makes Cz1 and 4 which can be distinguished from \beta galactosidase
	- Only the allele of z or of y which is cis with respect to o_c is constitutively expressed
		- trans allele remains strictly inducible
	- o_c is pleiotropic and dominant, and only acts on cis protein
- o_o mutations are closely linked to the o_c mutations but they lose ability to make any protein
	- o_o is recessive and can revert very rarely
	- They both affect a genetic element which is not expressed by an independent cytoplasmic product
- Units of coordinated expression - operons
	- enzymes of a sequence in an operon are not separately induced
