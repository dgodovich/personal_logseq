- Promoter
- Operator is identified by O_c mutations -> constitutive
- operator is at one extremity of the operon
- O_o mutations abolish the expression of all of the gene of the operon
	- these map to the z gene
- polar mutants are very similar to the O_o mutants but are not in the beginning
- O_o can be suppressed intragenically
	- probably acting at translation of messenger? not sure what this means
	- deletion of this region can still be inducible for y and x
	- therefore O_o region is not the operator or a transcription initiation sequence
	  background-color:: yellow
- Use a diploid for lac with homogenotic i+
  background-color:: red
	- i- mutants are recessive constitutives and are only expressed if recombination eliminates i+
	- O_c mutants are dominant constitutives and therefore are expressed immediately
	- Chromosome has a deletion covering all of lac except for i+o+ and beginning of z
	- Basically, the only possible constitutive mutant would be an O_c mutant on the F-lac plasmid (i+o+z+y+)
- induce mutations with various mutagenizing agents + spontaneous
- O_c mutants that they find
	- all map in the lac region
		- this is kind of by definition because all mutations have to be on the plasmid, and the plasmid only has lac
	- constitutive expression of z varies, but all induce to 100%
		- altered induction ratio
	- kinetics don't change
		- z is normal
	- 20% of mutants also go i+ -> i- which is near o, opposite z
		- they're saying it's a deletion, but this is impossible
- expression of the operon must be initiated at a site outside but adjacent to the operator
- i_s mutants
	- repressor is active on operator and prevents expression, and can't be removed
	- dominant lac-
	- if you use a homogenotic i_s mutant, you need to have an O_c mutation to get lac
	- they find that it's probably because of a mutation
- I'm not really following this
- ok I read enough
