- However, those strains in which prophage DNA replication has been blocked by a mutation in the rightward promoter (PR) start forming a repressor shortly after transfer to 30'C. In contrast, strains harboring a mutation in genes 0 or P, or a polar mutation in the y-CiI region,8 do not recover immunity at 30'C. In this paper, we analyze the mechanism which leads to this difference

- Therefore, the failure to recover immunity is dominant, suggesting that the prophage which is mutant in genes N and 0 makes a diffusible product that prevents repressor synthesis by either of the two genomes
