- Notes
- Introduction
	- Kinesin goes to the + end of MT, dynein goes to - end
	- Processivity - continuous movement
	- Gating mechanism - one subunit pauses in an intermediate until the partner does something
		- Different kinds of gates possible
		- Polymer gate - binding or releasing from the MT filament
		- nucleotide gate - ATPase cycle control
-
- Overview of kinesin mechanism
	- 2 identical heavy chains, 2 associated light chains
	- N terminus motor domain in heavy chain + coiled coil stalk
	- Kinesin can walk backwards if it's too heavily loaded
	- Hand over hand walk with alternating 16nm steps
	- Neck linker is the important part that does the rotation
- Overview of dynein mechanism
	- AAA family: ATPase Associated Activities
	- 2 heavy chains + many light chains, big complex
	- 6 AAA domains in a ring in each heavy chain
		- AAA1 is essential for motility
	- MT interface is at the end of a coiled coil stalk between AAA4 and 5
	- Also hand over hand but more irregular
		- steps between 4-32 nm and variable directionality
- Potential pathways for head-head communication
	- One motor domain must be able to influence the other in a gating mechanism
- Evidence for two head bound state of kinesin
- Tension also matters, not surprisingly
- stopped taking notes because bored
