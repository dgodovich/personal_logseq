- \sigma32 is induced by un or misfolded proteins in the cytoplasm
	- function of many proteins under its control is to assist protein folding in the cytoplasm
- \sigma\E is ethanol and heat inducible but less clear what it does
	- induced by increased expression of outer membrane proteins (OMPs)
- Introduction
	- \sigma\E transcribes \sigma32
		- so it was initially thought to be a supplementary heat shock \sigma factor
		- helps maintain high amounts of \sigma32 in response to severe stresses
	- It also transcribes degP
		- periplasmic endopeptidase that functions at high temps
		- I think this is how they got started thinking about the OMPs
- ((68d9eb2f-f0fd-4472-ab9d-7f5542b94e18))
	- Two strategies
		- Increasing amount of genes coding for \sigma\E positive regulators would get more \sigma\E
			- Reporter strain that has chloramphenicol resistance driven by rpoHP3 promoter
				- so if you have more \sigma\E, you'll be more resistant I guess
				- yep
				- use a plasmid library to get multicopy genes
		- loss of function mutations in positive regulators would decrease \sigma\E
			- transposon mutagenesis with mini-Mu in strain that has galK driven by rpoHP3
			- decreased \sigma\E would be white on MacConkey agar
				- should also be temperature sensitive since they have less degP
			- this avenue only found 1 locus (dse)
				- 76 minutes
	- Make gene fusions with the rpoHP3 promoter
		- this is the one targeted by \sigma\E
	- Figure 1 is mapping of the mutants
	- Table 1 is also mapping but with some additional annotations
		- ((68d9ed3c-36e3-431d-8ccb-511e0b2554fa))
		- number of isolates is how many times that one came up in the plasmid library
			- so ise18 is a big hit, and has an outer membrane protein
		- Many of them have OMP genes
		- dse has envZ
- ((68d9ecfa-db6b-4bd9-88ae-fa08ecb8c866)) E\sigma\e
	- Extension of the multicopy experiment
		- what if you just overexpress it
	- The specifically introduced plasmids containing OMP genes (OmpF,C,T,X)
		- these are porins, protease
		- i.e. varied proteins
	- and it works
	- they check by looking at \beta\gal activity because of the gene fusion
	- and by looking at degP mRNA levels with an RT-PCR I guess
	- and check that there is protein expression with a western in figure 3
- ((68d9ee86-70f6-449a-aa6b-90cb7c826a9a))
	- the dse locus was identified 16 times in the loss of function screen
	- ompR is a transcriptional activator of OmpC and OmpF (porins)
