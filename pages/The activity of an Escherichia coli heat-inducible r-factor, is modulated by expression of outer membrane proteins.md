- \sigma32 is induced by un or misfolded proteins in the cytoplasm
	- function of many proteins under its control is to assist protein folding in the cytoplasm
- \sigma\E is ethanol and heat inducible but less clear what it does
	- induced by increased expression of outer membrane proteins (OMPs)
- Introduction
	- \sigma\E transcribes \sigma32
		- so it was initially thought to be a supplementary heat shock \sigma factor
		- helps maintain high amounts of \sigma32 in response to severe stresses
	- It also transcribes degP
		- periplasmic endopeptidase that functions at high temps
		- I think this is how they got started thinking about the OMPs
- ((68d9eb2f-f0fd-4472-ab9d-7f5542b94e18))
	- Two strategies
		- Increasing amount of genes coding for \sigma\E positive regulators would get more \sigma\E
			- Reporter strain that has chloramphenicol resistance driven by rpoHP3 promoter
				- so if you have more \sigma\E, you'll be more resistant I guess
				- yep
				- use a plasmid library to get multicopy genes
		- loss of function mutations in positive regulators would decrease \sigma\E
			- transposon mutagenesis with mini-Mu in strain that has galK driven by rpoHP3
			- decreased \sigma\E would be white on MacConkey agar
				- should also be temperature sensitive since they have less degP
			- this avenue only found 1 locus (dse)
				- 76 minutes
	- Make gene fusions with the rpoHP3 promoter
		- this is the one targeted by \sigma\E
	- Figure 1 is mapping of the mutants
	- Table 1 is also mapping but with some additional annotations
		- ((68d9ed3c-36e3-431d-8ccb-511e0b2554fa))
		- number of isolates is how many times that one came up in the plasmid library
			- so ise18 is a big hit, and has an outer membrane protein
		- Many of them have OMP genes
		- dse has envZ
- ((68d9ecfa-db6b-4bd9-88ae-fa08ecb8c866)) E\sigma\e
	- Extension of the multicopy experiment
		- what if you just overexpress it
	- The specifically introduced plasmids containing OMP genes (OmpF,C,T,X)
		- these are porins, protease
		- i.e. varied proteins
	- and it works
	- they check by looking at \beta\gal activity because of the gene fusion
	- and by looking at degP mRNA levels with an RT-PCR I guess
	- and check that there is protein expression with a western in figure 3
- ((68d9ee86-70f6-449a-aa6b-90cb7c826a9a))
	- the dse locus was identified 16 times in the loss of function screen
	- ompR is a transcriptional activator of OmpC and OmpF (porins)
		- not yet clear if this is deactivating \sigma\E because
			- there's fewer OMPs generally
			- or OmpR activity itself is the issue
		- address this question by deleting ompR and overexpressing a different OMP
			- if it responds to OMPs, high activity
				- It's this one
			- if to OmpR activity, low \sigma\E activity
		- ((68d9efd3-0d19-43dc-9074-59bfacfe9c9f))
			- nice figure
	- they also check this with a different background that has lower OMP
- ((68d9efdf-cbd9-432a-bf92-9ce89686ed35))
	- Fractionate cell into cytoplasmic, inner membrane, periplasm, outer membrane
		- this is in the overexpressing OmpX
		- this shows that it's in the outer membrane, but not conclusively that that's what \sigma\E is responding to
	- All of these results are summarized in ((68d9f238-f24d-4ade-a4e5-4f920993e8d9))
	- Test if cells that accumulate OMP precursors in the cytoplasm have high \sigma\E activity
		- delete secB (I guess this does some transport?)
			- yes, in the tommentary figure it's a chaperone protein to get them out into the periplasm
			- this lowers \sigma\E activity
			- fig 7 A
	- Ok, what if it's something about the secretion
		- test with overproduction of periplasmic proteins which should have similar secretory properties
			- no result
			- fig 7 B
	- Mislocalization of OMPs or jamming
		- OmpC variant that's missing 2 AA
			- able to be secreted, but then doesn't incorporate into the OM
		- This gives a huge increase in \sigma\E activity (10 fold)
		- fig 7 C
	- Is it misfolded proteins?
		- dsbA gene facilitates disulfide bond formation
		- folding chaperone
		- deletion of this protein induced \sigma\E activity
		- fig 7 D
	- Do periplasmic proteins trigger it?
		- engineer a misfolded periplasmic protein by a gene fusion with a different bacteria protein
		- exported but not integrated
		- no effect
		- fig 7 E
	- \sigma\E is induced by misfolded OMPs
	  background-color:: green
- DegP does not influence \sigma\E activity
	- deletion doesn't change anything
		- expected that it might because there would be an enrichment of degradation targets
	- overexpression doesn't change anything
		- it could have decreased because it removes misfolded protein
	- ((68d9f3ed-8337-41fc-b8b7-a5241d7207fb))
- Things that induce \sigma\E do not induced \sigma32
	- not the other way around
		- high temp induces both
		- but that's probably a side effect of something else then?
	- ((68d9f3f5-24f3-4787-a5ab-97b82184a18b))
- ((68d9f400-ed5c-4d9b-8b44-da22e018762a))
	- Go over the pros and cons of their selection methods and why they did both
	- And a summary of what changes \sigma\E levels
	- ((68d9f48e-ad6f-4c80-8d61-8cf8f0adfa2b))
		- results suggest that it's in the later steps, membrane association
		- Extracellular location means that there must be some signal transduction pathway
	- What is the signal?
		- total amount of OMPs
			- could be composition of the OM, or flow rate towards the OM
		- Seems more likely to be flow rate, or something to do with proper folding
		- probably not the first one since things that changed OM in the same way had opposite effects on \sigma\E expression
	- Why is it induced by heat in the same way as \sigma32?
		- 32 is induced by conditions that increase misfolded proteins in the cytoplasm
		- E is induced by increase OMPs in compartments outside the cytoplasm
		- rpoH is regulated by E, it's not most of the transcription
			- and E is post translationally modified, so maybe that also changes things
		- could be doing the same thing for different compartments
		- heat destabilizes both, so it looks like they're the same
- ((68d9f690-754e-434d-b5f5-2d683a36c05c))
	- skimming
- Tom questions
	- Be prepared to describe the two approaches used by the authors to probe \sigma\E function. Do you think these approaches would have worked for RpoS or \sigma32?
		- approach 1 was overexpression of a plasmid library by attaching genes to the rpoHP3 promoter with chloramphenicol resistance as a selection
			- if you can grow at higher levels, you have more activity of that promoter
			- most of the regions were isolated only 1 time
				- there might be more genes that they just didn't test
		- approach 2 was loss-of-function in positive regulators
			- gal selection
		- I'm not sure why it wouldn't work for \sigma32?
			- could it be that because that promoter is activated really only at high temps it would be harder to get mutants?
		- RpoS which is the stationary phase promoter might be harder because there's probably a ton of things that make it come out of or stay in stationary phase
			- Too many things to test and you get a muddy signal
