- \sigma32 is induced by un or misfolded proteins in the cytoplasm
	- function of many proteins under its control is to assist protein folding in the cytoplasm
- \sigma\E is ethanol and heat inducible but less clear what it does
	- induced by increased expression of outer membrane proteins (OMPs)
- Introduction
	- \sigma\E transcribes \sigma32
		- so it was initially thought to be a supplementary heat shock \sigma factor
		- helps maintain high amounts of \sigma32 in response to severe stresses
	- It also transcribes degP
		- periplasmic endopeptidase that functions at high temps
		- I think this is how they got started thinking about the OMPs
- ((68d9eb2f-f0fd-4472-ab9d-7f5542b94e18))
	- Two strategies
		- Increasing amount of genes coding for \sigma\E positive regulators would get more \sigma\E
			- Reporter strain that has chloramphenicol resistance driven by rpoHP3 promoter
				- so if you have more \sigma\E, you'll be more resistant I guess
				- yep
				- use a plasmid library to get multicopy genes
		- loss of function mutations in positive regulators would decrease \sigma\E
			- transposon mutagenesis with mini-Mu in strain that has galK driven by rpoHP3
			- decreased \sigma\E would be white on MacConkey agar
				- should also be temperature sensitive since they have less degP
			- this avenue only found 1 locus
				- 76 minutes
	- Make gene fusions with the rpoHP3 promoter
		- this is the one targeted by \sigma\E
