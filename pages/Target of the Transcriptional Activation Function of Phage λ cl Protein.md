- [[Abstract]]
	- Activation of transcription initiation by the cI protein of phage λ is thought to be mediated by a direct interaction between cI and RNA polymerase at the
	                P
	                RM
	                promoter. Two negatively charged amino acid residues in the DNA binding domain of cI play a key role in activation, suggesting that these residues contact RNA polymerase. The subunit of RNA polymerase involved was identified by selecting polymerase mutants that restored the activation function of a mutant form of cI protein. Although previous studies suggest that several activators interact with the α subunit of RNA polymerase, the results here suggest that cI interacts with the σ subunit. An arginine to histidine change near the carboxyl terminus of σ specifically suppresses an aspartic acid to asparagine change in the activation region of cI. This finding supports the direct-contact model and suggests that a cluster of positively charged residues near the carboxyl terminus of σ is the target of the negatively charged activation region of cI.
