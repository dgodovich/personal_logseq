	- Notes
		- Joshua Lederburg Nobel paper on gene recombination in E coli
			- thought that there was a transient diploid that resolved to haploid
			- parents are equal
		- William Hayes proved that wrong
			- Hfr *E. Coli* strain
			- Cross used was Hfr met- str R X F- thr- leu- str S, streptomycin inhibits
			- Reciprocal cross Hfr met- str S X F- thr- leu- str R, streptomycin does nothing
			- Proves that Hfr is the one that does stuff - donor. F- is the recipient
		- In an F+ population there are Hfr mutants
			- Fluctuation test described by Luria and Delbruck  (Nobel)
			- Measure frequency of Hfr formation in population - depends on when mutation happens
			- Mixed culture will have distribution
			- F plasmid integrates into chromosome

	- competent #card
		- bacteria that is capable of picking up DNA from the environment
	- transduction #card
		- horizontal gene transfer mediated by bacteriophages transmitting DNA
	- conjugation #card
		- horizontal gene transfer through sex pilus + F plasmid copying
		- Hfr cells are particularly good at this
