	- Notes
		- Jacob & Wollman discussion
			- Joshua Lederburg Nobel paper on gene recombination in E coli
				- thought that there was a transient diploid that resolved to haploid
				- parents are equal
			- William Hayes proved that wrong
				- Hfr *E. Coli* strain
				- Cross used was Hfr met- str R X F- thr- leu- str S, streptomycin inhibits
				- Reciprocal cross Hfr met- str S X F- thr- leu- str R, streptomycin does nothing
				- Proves that Hfr is the one that does stuff - donor. F- is the recipient
			- In an F+ population there are Hfr mutants
				- Fluctuation test described by Luria and Delbruck  (Nobel)
				- Measure frequency of Hfr formation in population - depends on when mutation happens
				- Mixed culture will have distribution
				- F plasmid integrates into chromosome
					- thought was that it breaks and linearizes the chromosome
					- Now has a start and the end (O start and Hfr end)
			- Barbara McClintock transposons? Nobel later
			- Hfr requires transferring of the entire F region which only happens if the whole chromosome is transferred
				- ~100 minutes to transfer the whole chromosome
			- F+ factor can come back out of the chromosome
				- can pick up chromosomal genes as it does this - now called an F' factor
				- Provides a way to make stable diploids
			- Conjugation transfers single stranded DNA
				- Pilus extends and contracts, contraction brings together the bacteria
					- Mating pair on solid surface that blocks being pulled together, DNA transfers through the pilus
					- Otherwise they get pulled together and pilus goes away
			- T is threonine, L is leucine, T_1^S is sensitive to phage T1
			- Markers within 2 minutes will have higher than 50% chance of coming together
