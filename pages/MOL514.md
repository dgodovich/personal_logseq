		- [[Genetic code: the 'nonsense' triplets for chain termination and their suppression]]
	- Notes
		- Nonsense suppressors are extragenic suppressors
			- The genes are suppressed because of something outside of the gene body
		- Frameshift is intragenic - something is wrong with the inside of the gene
		- rII A and B are cistrons
			- complementation test works by infecting a cell with multiple different phages

  collapsed:: true
	- Notes
		- r stands for rapid lysis phage - tiny plaques
		- rII mutants can grow on on B (r type) but not on K\lambda
			- aborted infection
			- \lambda lysogens make a protein that kill T4 infected cells
				- halting the spread of the phage
			- Things based on this have been very effective
				- CRISPR, restriction enzymes
		- Classical picture is that genes are single points on a linear chromosome
			- Can't be split
		- Benzer shows that you can split genes, building on Watson and Crick DNA structure
		- Spot test
			- Can't make a plaque if you can't kill both kinds of bacteria
				- Because plaque is a very large scale death of bacteria
			- Just killing B isn't enough because it's mixed in with K\lambda
		- Freese is right on the facts but his interpretation is wrong
		- Frameshift mutations are almost always null
			- Much more severe, kill the gene completely
			- Missense doesn't do that
		- Code is not overlapping is from previous evidence
			- Only 1 AA is changed - implies no overlap
		- Intragenic suppressors
		- FC0 is a non-leaky r mutant
			- after suppressing mutation you get wt
			- But just the suppressor is r mutant as well
		- mutant 6 has a line because it will not recombine with any of the other things above it
			- All the stacked things are stacked because they won't recombine with each other
				- As in they're in the same locus
			- This actually deletes 10 bp (-1 effective)
			- The whole map in figure 2 is done with 3 factor crosses of phages

	- Notes
		- General problem of finding essential nature of genes
		- Horowitz and Leupold is old, but appreciate how difficult doing science was
		- Beadle and Tatum use Neurospora to find nutritional media
			- Tatum picked E. Coli K-12 to work on, Lederburg found conjugation
		- Temperature is a screen, not a selection
			- If you do screen you do a mutagenesis
		- They probably should have started growing everyone at 25 deg
			- Replica plating into minimal and complete at 40
		- auxanography is a cross of 11 media types
			- Growth in media 1 and 8 only means the nutritional mutant is in phenylalanine
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1757343471013_0.png)
		- Keio Collection
			- collection of E.coli mutants that has every gene knocked out except for essential ones
			- ~300 genes, which is the same order of synthetic enzymes
		- 4000ish genes, about 1000 that we have no idea what the function is
		- Second paper
			- They really blasted that shit
				- Normal MNNG dosage is 1/10 amount for 1/3 the time
			- Specific hit rate for a gene is ~.3%, so screening 1000 you should hit your gene with 95% confidence
			- Parental mix is to check that there isn't an inhibitor of polymerase activity
			- mutant is very sensitive to DNA damage, but they can find a revertant
				- That means that the new DNA damage happened in the same place, since it was possible to be fixed
				- revertant for this is 1/10^9 probability
					- basically a single BP mutation
			- They found mutant for DNA pol 1
				- Klenow fragment - C terminus of DNA pol1 - used for first PCR reactions
			- Deletion for this mutant can't grow on complete media but not in minimal media
				- This is because you grow too fast on complete media and DNA repair is more important there
			-
		- Kornberg used phiX174 phage DNA because it packages ssDNA

		- Jacob & Wollman discussion
		  collapsed:: true
			- Joshua Lederburg Nobel paper on gene recombination in E coli
				- thought that there was a transient diploid that resolved to haploid
				- parents are equal
			- William Hayes proved that wrong
				- Hfr *E. Coli* strain
				- Cross used was Hfr met- str R X F- thr- leu- str S, streptomycin inhibits
				- Reciprocal cross Hfr met- str S X F- thr- leu- str R, streptomycin does nothing
				- Proves that Hfr is the one that does stuff - donor. F- is the recipient
			- In an F+ population there are Hfr mutants
				- Fluctuation test described by Luria and Delbruck  (Nobel)
				- Measure frequency of Hfr formation in population - depends on when mutation happens
				- Mixed culture will have distribution
				- F plasmid integrates into chromosome
					- thought was that it breaks and linearizes the chromosome
					- Now has a start and the end (O start and Hfr end)
			- Barbara McClintock transposons? Nobel later
			- Hfr requires transferring of the entire F region which only happens if the whole chromosome is transferred
				- ~100 minutes to transfer the whole chromosome
			- F+ factor can come back out of the chromosome
				- can pick up chromosomal genes as it does this - now called an F' factor
				- Provides a way to make stable diploids
			- Conjugation transfers single stranded DNA
				- Pilus extends and contracts, contraction brings together the bacteria
					- Mating pair on solid surface that blocks being pulled together, DNA transfers through the pilus
					- Otherwise they get pulled together and pilus goes away
			- T is threonine, L is leucine, T_1^S is sensitive to phage T1
			- Markers within 2 minutes will have higher than 50% chance of coming together
				- ~ 80kb (40 kb transferred in each minute)
			- Transfer starts behind the arrow
		- BAC - bacterial artificial chromosome
			- big pieces of DNA into F plasmid
		- Gross and Engelsberg
			- Norton Zinder discovered transduction, Lederburg's student (no nobel)
			- abortive transduction is a type of complementation
				- Expression of transduced DNA without recombination
				- Not transferred to daughter cells, can't replicate
			- Generalized transduction
				- Can transfer any gene!
				- When it lyses a cell it can pick up bits of the host DNA rather than viral DNA
				- Transduction is rare, need to have a selection
			- Selection and screening are not the same
			- Negative interference
				- Table 5 difference is the chance? of 4 cross overs
				- numbers are smaller because you have more than just recombination
				- You can get just integration of the specific component
			- Need to review Holliday junctions
			- Group C has abortive transduction because the mutation is in a regulatory protein
				- Two proteins are disturbed because the regulatory is required for both
			- Determine pathway order by using epistasis
		- Recombination allows you to deremine order of mutations
		- Complementation allows you to determine which gene is affected
		- Epistasis is tests of double mutants - multiple genes going to one thing
