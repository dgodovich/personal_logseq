	- 298 genes controlled by CAP
	- constitutive mutations in the repressor are recessive in diploid analysis
		- has been said before but I gotta repeat it
	- c_I is dominant
		- this one is a constitutively active repressor
	- second paper uses Lac EB5 mutation
		- mutation in the promoter that makes it close to the consensus sequence
		- this is in cis because it's a site that is not coding
	- CAP sites have dyad symmetry
	- Class 1 CAP sites are far away from TSS
		- -61.5, -72, -82, -92
	- Class 2 CAP sites are closer to the TSS, at -42, where it interferes with the polymerase binding site
	- CAP and RNA pol \alpha\CTD have contact
		- \alpha\CTD is wiggly so it doesn't show up on structures
		- moves around so it can reach over to the further away loci
	- Class 1 CAP sites overlap -35 region and can bind at the same time as \sigma
		- they're on two sides of DNA
	- mutants that can't activate are pc mutants (positive control)
		- need to avoid getting a null
			- with c1 you can do this by using phage for immunity
		- gal is an interesting system because it has two promoters
			- one for catabolism, one for anabolism
			- look for a lac-/gal-
				- this means that the same amino acid is required to activate both lac and gal
	- upstream binding sites affect K_B rate (polymerase attaching to promoter)
	- closer binding sites affect k_f rate
	- activator binding sites are generally always close to the promoter
		- there needs to be a direct interaction with activator and polymerase complex
	- E coli has 7 operons for ribosomal RNAs
		- upstream binding sites (UP)
		- these are super strong promoters and are like always on
	- P_RM \Delta50 is cut just after O_r2
	- interaction with \sigma is closer
		- araC
		- CAP in araC is further away and is probably interacting with \alpha

		- [[Target of the Transcriptional Activation Function of Phage Î» cl Protein]]
	- \lambda repressor prevents transcription from P_R by binding to the promoter site and blocking RNA pol binding
		- the same thing is happening at P_L
	- closed RNA pol complex is very stable
	- promoter can be weak because of a defect in either formation of the closed or open complex
	- Paper 1
		- activators work through cooperativity and proximity
		- localized mutagenesis on the plasmid and then insert the plasmid into a strain
			- nitrosoguanidine is a potent alkylating agent
		- Avoid frameshift and nonsense / null mutations in c1 by looking for immunity to super infection from phage
		- Table 1
			- line 2 shows that O_r3- doesn't impact the pc mutants
				- there's a slight increase in wild type because there's probably some binding to O_r3 when you have a high concentration of repressor
			- line 3 shows that O_r2 is necessary for repression
		- Maxam-Gilbert sequencing is apparently an enormous pain in the ass
			- so they do restriction enzyme cutting to try to get minimal fragment
		- \lambda repressor is probably stimulating open complex formation
	- Paper 2
		- where does the repressor contact polymerase?
			- looking for allele specific suppressor
		- E. coli carrying a salmonella prophage
			- "Susskind works with salmonella, so that's just how it will be"
		- PCR mutagenesis
			- error prone PCR
			- can buy kits for this now, these have very specific targeting with primers
		- rpoD has to be dominant because it's a different strain so wt rpoD (salmonella) can't activate the phage regions at all (because they're e coli)
		- R596 is a site that interacts with activators
			- that's what going on with CAP in ara operon, and with c1 in \lambda
			- this is conserved
		- c1 is at position -41 relative to the promoter
			- contacting \sigma70
			- so araC binding site relative to the araBAD promoter is also -41
		- Activators are most often stimulating open complex formation
			- binding on different faces of DNA

	- no N, \lambda is totally dead and can't do anything
	  collapsed:: true
		- so it looked like a positive regulator
		- But it's a transcriptional regulator (antitermination)
	- After N transcription, you get a race between cII and cro
		- cro for lytic pathway, cII for lysogeny
		- likely cII binds DNA with higher affinity than cro
	- c17 makes a whole bunch of operators by making a new promoter
	- N doesn't bind DNA, it binds RNA
		- protects the polymerase and makes it resistant to termination
	- his operon shows that there's multiple ways to stop transcription
	- Figure 1 is the 5' UTR
		- but a small bit of it is translated
			- but that doesn't do anything
			- it just has to be translated for the regulation to happen
	- this is actually a very common regulatory mechanism for amino acids
		- the attenuator is a normal transcription termination signal that's just in a weird place
	- \rho independent termination
		- stem loop /hairpin exerts force on the polymerase to pull the message out
		- important that the loop is followed by a bunch of U
			- A-U bonds are weak so they can be pulled
		- "DNA gazing"
			- by simply looking at the DNA you can find the promoter sequence, determine if they're weak or strong
			- and also find termination sites based on hairpin plus U enrichment

	- different form of positive control
		- by altering promoter activity with sigma factors
	- RNAP looks like a crab claw
	- promoters under negative control are strong promoters, active control need help
		- activators can help at open / closed complex or both
	- \sigma70 shouldn't be sitting on a promoter without a polymerase
		- this is why it doesn't have DNA binding activity
	- I_c mutations are promoter mutations that move closer to consensus
		- mal lac and ara all need CAP to function
			- select for \sigma70 mutations that have a similar phenotype to I_c
	- The ones that do nothing might be interacting with araC
		- doesn't help with DNA binding but still phenocopies I_c mutation
		- So helps araC bind somehow?
	- RC584 probably changes the consensus sequence
	- TI440 probably makes it more flexible
	- sigma factors have 3 names
		- \sigma32, or rpoH, or \sigma\H
		- number comes from somewhere, protein has a different name

	- Paper 1
		- ara promoter is after araC
			- araC is on a different promoter
		- Method of isolating the deletions
			- mutation in araD is toxic (in the same way as gal - poisons the cell)
			- revertants of this can delete araC or the operator so you don't express the whole operon
		- negative control promoter is a strong promoter

	- Direct repeat = deletion
	  collapsed:: true
	- inverted repeat = inversion
	- 3 main pathways of recombination in E.Coli
		- RecBCD
		- RecF
		- RecE
			- resembles cryptic phage, very similar to the \lambda recombination pathway
	- RecBCD requires a double stranded break
		- it's a helicase so it opens the DNA
		- cuts at Chi site
	- RecA coats the overhang
		- This does strand invasion or synapsis
	- Negative interference
		- means that there's appears to be more recombinants than there really are
		- Mismatch repair of non recombinants
		- The crossing over that's not complete (no exchange of outside markers), if there's a mutation in one side of that it'll fix with repair and look like a recombinant
			- non-crossover recombination forms heteroduplexes
	- In a half-reciprocal event the non joining strand gets destroyed
		- inversions and circle capture can't be half reciprocal
		- Deletions can be because you get two things out
			- One of them is the circle
	- Homologous recombination is much more common than transposition
		- parent line can do circle capture to become his+
			- Can't recombine as linear DNA because there's no homology on the left side
		- ara insertion can also do inversion
		- pncB can only become his+ if you do circle capture
	- RecF does circle formation
		- their model is not right
	- Double stranded break requires RecBCD
	- Single strand break goes through RecF
	- RecA needed for both do to strand invasion
	- RecBCD has very strong exonuclease activity
		- degrades linear double stranded DNA
		- somehow it can distinguish between double stranded breaks and linear DNA, unclear how
	- ssDNA you don't have to worry about RecBCD nuclease activity
		- and you also don't have to worry about making a 3' overhang because it's single stranded
	- No recA means no synapsis
		- Beta probably jumps in when DNA replication is happening
			- goes right into the replication fork
				- lagging strand is open ssDNA
			- or transcription
				- paper 2 rules this out by checking for strand bias and they found no direction
				- inversion of gal operon changes the strand bias
	- Beta recombination is assisted by a strain that has no mismatch repair
		- Mismatch repair works by sensing methylation and it removes the new strand because it's undermethylated
		- So recombination would happen way faster if you don't have mismatch repair

		  collapsed:: true
			- Temperature sensitive mutations are conditional lethal
				- That means that they're essential genes
				- Pretty much has to be a missense mutation because nonsense or frameshift gives non-functional protein
			- One that aren't suppressor exchange the amino acid in the original mutant to a different one
				- Suppressor must map to a different place
				- Reverts even though it isn't a suppressor by changing the properties of the mutant protein
			- Reversion is function specific
				- The original mutation is in function X, the suppressor is also in function X
			- Suppressor mutations have 2 phenotypes
				- Suppression phenotype is dominant
				- Temperature / cold sensitivity is recessive
					- loss of function at a particular condition means that it's recessive
			- Temperature sensitive mutations
				- Problem in protein stability
				- denatures at non-permissive temperature for high temp
				- Cold sensitive is probably too stable, too strong binding - can't move
				- This explains why it's easier to get temp sensitive
					- Much more likely to get a destabilizing effect than a stabilizing one

		- Nonsense suppressors are extragenic suppressors
			- The genes are suppressed because of something outside of the gene body
		- Frameshift is intragenic - something is wrong with the inside of the gene
		- rII A and B are cistrons
			- complementation test works by infecting a cell with multiple different phages
			- think about proteins for complementation
				- Are all the proteins you need there
			- Dominant mutation doesn't work with a complementation test
				- Will take over and not allow recombination
				- Most of the time dominant mutations affect multimers so you get a killer subunit
		- Deletions can't revert
		- Burst size is the number of phage produced by a single cell when it lyses
		- MOI is number of phage/number of bacteria
		- mutants from paper 1 table 2 are point mutants
			- This is confirmed because they can be reverted by a base analogue
			- Also not frameshift because they can grow on KB3 which has the nonsense suppressor
		- Hydroxylamine mutagenesis you add it directly to the phage
			- Make a chemical modification to the DNA
		- 2-aminopurine addition would do nothing to phage
			- Base analogs require replication

				- F plasmid integrates into chromosome
					- thought was that it breaks and linearizes the chromosome
					- Now has a start and the end (O start and Hfr end)

				- Expression of transduced DNA without recombination
				- Not transferred to daughter cells, can't replicate
			- Generalized transduction
				- Can transfer any gene!
				- When it lyses a cell it can pick up bits of the host DNA rather than viral DNA
				- Transduction is rare, need to have a selection
			- Selection and screening are not the same
			- Negative interference
				- Table 5 difference is the chance? of 4 cross overs
				- numbers are smaller because you have more than just recombination
				- You can get just integration of the specific component
			- Need to review Holliday junctions
			- Group C has abortive transduction because the mutation is in a regulatory protein
				- Two proteins are disturbed because the regulatory is required for both
			- Determine pathway order by using epistasis
		- Recombination allows you to deremine order of mutations
		- Complementation allows you to determine which gene is affected
