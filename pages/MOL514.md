	- Notes
		- General problem of finding essential nature of genes
		- Horowitz and Leupold is old, but appreciate how difficult doing science was
		- Beadle and Tatum use Neurospora to find nutritional media
			- Tatum picked E. Coli K-12 to work on, Lederburg found conjugation
		- Temperature is a screen, not a selection
			- If you do screen you do a mutagenesis

			- Joshua Lederburg Nobel paper on gene recombination in E coli
				- thought that there was a transient diploid that resolved to haploid
				- parents are equal
			- William Hayes proved that wrong
				- Hfr *E. Coli* strain
				- Cross used was Hfr met- str R X F- thr- leu- str S, streptomycin inhibits
				- Reciprocal cross Hfr met- str S X F- thr- leu- str R, streptomycin does nothing
				- Proves that Hfr is the one that does stuff - donor. F- is the recipient
			- In an F+ population there are Hfr mutants
				- Fluctuation test described by Luria and Delbruck  (Nobel)
				- Measure frequency of Hfr formation in population - depends on when mutation happens
				- Mixed culture will have distribution
				- F plasmid integrates into chromosome
					- thought was that it breaks and linearizes the chromosome
					- Now has a start and the end (O start and Hfr end)
			- Barbara McClintock transposons? Nobel later
			- Hfr requires transferring of the entire F region which only happens if the whole chromosome is transferred
				- ~100 minutes to transfer the whole chromosome
			- F+ factor can come back out of the chromosome
				- can pick up chromosomal genes as it does this - now called an F' factor
				- Provides a way to make stable diploids
			- Conjugation transfers single stranded DNA
				- Pilus extends and contracts, contraction brings together the bacteria
					- Mating pair on solid surface that blocks being pulled together, DNA transfers through the pilus
					- Otherwise they get pulled together and pilus goes away
			- T is threonine, L is leucine, T_1^S is sensitive to phage T1
			- Markers within 2 minutes will have higher than 50% chance of coming together
				- ~ 80kb (40 kb transferred in each minute)
			- Transfer starts behind the arrow
		- BAC - bacterial artificial chromosome
			- big pieces of DNA into F plasmid
		- Gross and Engelsberg
			- Norton Zinder discovered transduction, Lederburg's student (no nobel)
			- abortive transduction is a type of complementation
				- Expression of transduced DNA without recombination
				- Not transferred to daughter cells, can't replicate
			- Generalized transduction
				- Can transfer any gene!
				- When it lyses a cell it can pick up bits of the host DNA rather than viral DNA
				- Transduction is rare, need to have a selection
			- Selection and screening are not the same
			- Negative interference
				- Table 5 difference is the chance? of 4 cross overs
				- numbers are smaller because you have more than just recombination
				- You can get just integration of the specific component
			- Need to review Holliday junctions
			- Group C has abortive transduction because the mutation is in a regulatory protein
				- Two proteins are disturbed because the regulatory is required for both
			- Determine pathway order by using epistasis
		- Recombination allows you to deremine order of mutations
		- Complementation allows you to determine which gene is affected
		- Epistasis is tests of double mutants - multiple genes going to one thing
