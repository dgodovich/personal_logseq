	- Notes
		- General problem of finding essential nature of genes
		- Horowitz and Leupold is old, but appreciate how difficult doing science was
		- Beadle and Tatum use Neurospora to find nutritional media
			- Tatum picked E. Coli K-12 to work on, Lederburg found conjugation
		- Temperature is a screen, not a selection
			- If you do screen you do a mutagenesis
		- They probably should have started growing everyone at 25 deg
			- Replica plating into minimal and complete at 40
		- auxanography is a cross of 11 media types
			- Growth in media 1 and 8 only means the nutritional mutant is in phenylalanine

		- Keio Collection
			- collection of E.coli mutants that has every gene knocked out except for essential ones
			- ~300 genes, which is the same order of synthetic enzymes
		- 4000ish genes, about 1000 that we have no idea what the function is
		- Second paper
			- They really blasted that shit
				- Normal MNNG dosage is 1/10 amount for 1/3 the time
			- Specific hit rate for a gene is ~.3%, so screening 1000 you should hit your gene with 95% confidence
			- Parental mix is to check that there isn't an inhibitor of polymerase activity
			- mutant is very sensitive to DNA damage, but they can find a revertant
				- That means that the new DNA damage happened in the same place, since it was possible to be fixed
				- revertant for this is 1/10^9 probability
					- basically a single BP mutation
			- They found mutant for DNA pol 1
				- Klenow fragment - C terminus of DNA pol1 - used for first PCR reactions
			- Deletion for this mutant can't grow on complete media but not in minimal media
				- This is because you grow too fast on complete media and DNA repair is more important there
			-
		- Kornberg used phiX174 phage DNA because it packages ssDNA

		  collapsed:: true
			- Joshua Lederburg Nobel paper on gene recombination in E coli
				- thought that there was a transient diploid that resolved to haploid
				- parents are equal
			- William Hayes proved that wrong
				- Hfr *E. Coli* strain
				- Cross used was Hfr met- str R X F- thr- leu- str S, streptomycin inhibits
				- Reciprocal cross Hfr met- str S X F- thr- leu- str R, streptomycin does nothing
				- Proves that Hfr is the one that does stuff - donor. F- is the recipient
			- In an F+ population there are Hfr mutants
				- Fluctuation test described by Luria and Delbruck  (Nobel)
				- Measure frequency of Hfr formation in population - depends on when mutation happens
				- Mixed culture will have distribution
				- F plasmid integrates into chromosome
					- thought was that it breaks and linearizes the chromosome
					- Now has a start and the end (O start and Hfr end)
			- Barbara McClintock transposons? Nobel later
			- Hfr requires transferring of the entire F region which only happens if the whole chromosome is transferred
				- ~100 minutes to transfer the whole chromosome
			- F+ factor can come back out of the chromosome
				- can pick up chromosomal genes as it does this - now called an F' factor
				- Provides a way to make stable diploids
			- Conjugation transfers single stranded DNA
				- Pilus extends and contracts, contraction brings together the bacteria
					- Mating pair on solid surface that blocks being pulled together, DNA transfers through the pilus
					- Otherwise they get pulled together and pilus goes away
			- T is threonine, L is leucine, T_1^S is sensitive to phage T1
			- Markers within 2 minutes will have higher than 50% chance of coming together
				- ~ 80kb (40 kb transferred in each minute)
			- Transfer starts behind the arrow
		- BAC - bacterial artificial chromosome
			- big pieces of DNA into F plasmid
		- Gross and Engelsberg
			- Norton Zinder discovered transduction, Lederburg's student (no nobel)
			- abortive transduction is a type of complementation
				- Expression of transduced DNA without recombination
				- Not transferred to daughter cells, can't replicate
			- Generalized transduction
				- Can transfer any gene!
				- When it lyses a cell it can pick up bits of the host DNA rather than viral DNA
				- Transduction is rare, need to have a selection
			- Selection and screening are not the same
			- Negative interference
				- Table 5 difference is the chance? of 4 cross overs
				- numbers are smaller because you have more than just recombination
				- You can get just integration of the specific component
			- Need to review Holliday junctions
			- Group C has abortive transduction because the mutation is in a regulatory protein
				- Two proteins are disturbed because the regulatory is required for both
			- Determine pathway order by using epistasis
		- Recombination allows you to deremine order of mutations
		- Complementation allows you to determine which gene is affected
		- Epistasis is tests of double mutants - multiple genes going to one thing
