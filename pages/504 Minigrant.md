	- [[Large-scale control over collective cell migration using light-activated epidermal growth factor receptors]]
- Right so I did not do that very well
- Some notes
	- I need to read earlier and take more meaningful notes
	- I need to figure out some way to structure my work so that I do not have to do everything last minute
	- Grant writing wise i feel like it was alright but man
		- very stressful for like no reason
- Logseq was not very helpful for it because I didn't use this page
	- I think generally with logseq I need to think a bit more / read or watch some guides to more powerfully use pages. I think I'm not using it to it's full potential
	- The zotero integration and note taking is pretty great and that is moving up in my workflow as I get used to it and use it in more places
	- But as of now that's kind of the only way that I really use it
		- Half for class notes but a good chunk of that is in word docs so not really
-
-
- I'm thinking it basically has to be on / related to my rotation project
- Downstream of optoEGFR there's PI3K mediated signaling that does migration
	- Do we know what the actual mechanism of this is?
- We spent so much time in the course talking about actin polymerization and whatnot for migration
	- Maybe I go towards that as the tailoring for 504?
	- How does the cell integrate a travelling optogenetic signal and decide which way to go?
	  background-color:: yellow
		- I think this is an interesting problem in the field that Jared pitched to me / I already know something about
-
- Cell integration of signaling waves
	- Travelling erk waves in migration / wound healing
		- mouse epidermis
		- stefano's work on zebrafish scales
		- reference Kevin and Richard's paper
		- I feel like pretty much all of the literature is on ERK, but their data suggests that it's PI3K dependent
			- and not through Akt
			- So what's that doing?
	- Need time resolution here?
		- speed of wavefront matters and the cell directional response is different
	- Neighbor information?
		- What if you illuminate the bottom half of a cell and also have a wave moving across the field?
		- Neighboring signalling? is that an appropriate proxy? maintain some amount of it across periods
	- What's the biochem
		- I think there's ways to answer this with the optoEGFR cell line which are interesting but that's not super biochem-y which is fairly important for the course
-
- Aims
	- What's PI3K doing downstream
		- coIP? purification? localization?
	- How does the cell sense temporal resolution of wavefront
		- FRAP?
