- I'm thinking it basically has to be on / related to my rotation project
- Downstream of optoEGFR there's PI3K mediated signaling that does migration
	- Do we know what the actual mechanism of this is?
- We spent so much time in the course talking about actin polymerization and whatnot for migration
	- Maybe I go towards that as the tailoring for 504?
	- How does the cell integrate a travelling optogenetic signal and decide which way to go?

		- I think this is an interesting problem in the field that Jared pitched to me / I already know something about
-
- Cell integration of signaling waves
	- Travelling erk waves in migration / wound healing
		- mouse epidermis
		- stefano's work on zebrafish scales
		- reference Kevin and Richard's paper
		- I feel like pretty much all of the literature is on ERK, but their data suggests that it's PI3K dependent
			- and not through Akt
			- So what's that doing?
	- Need time resolution here?
		- speed of wavefront matters and the cell directional response is different
	- What's the biochem
		- I think there's ways to answer this with the optoEGFR cell line which are interesting but that's not super biochem-y which is fairly important for the course

- Aims
	- What's PI3K doing downstream
		- coIP? purification? localization?
	- How does the cell sense temporal resolution of wavefront
		- FRAP?
