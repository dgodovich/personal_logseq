- I'm thinking it basically has to be on / related to my rotation project
- Downstream of optoEGFR there's PI3K mediated signaling that does migration
	- Do we know what the actual mechanism of this is?
- We spent so much time in the course talking about actin polymerization and whatnot for migration
	- Maybe I go towards that as the tailoring for 504?
	- How does the cell integrate a travelling optogenetic signal and decide which way to go?
