- [[Abstract]]
	- In budding yeast, many proteins involved in endocytic internalization, including adaptors and actin cytoskeletal proteins, are localized to cortical patches of differing protein composition. Using multicolor real-time fluorescence microscopy and particle tracking algorithms, we define an early endocytic pathway wherein an invariant sequence of changes in cortical patch protein composition correlates with changes in patch motility. Three Arp2/3 activators each showed a distinct behavior, suggesting distinct patch-related endocytic functions. Actin polymerization occurs late in the endocytic pathway and is required both for endocytic internalization and for patch disassembly. In cells lacking the highly conserved endocytic protein Sla2p, patch motility was arrested and actin comet tails associated with endocytic patch complexes. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching of the actin comet tails revealed that endocytic complexes are nucleation sites for rapid actin polymerization. Attention is now focused on the mechanisms by which the order and timing of events in this endocytic pathway are achieved.

- Introduction
	- Endocytosis is a complex pathway with many proteins
	- Actin is important but it's not super clear how
		- might drive membrane invagination
		- or movement of vesicles into the cytoplasm
	- actin patches in budding yeast
		- on the cortex
		- many endocytotic proteins localize here
- Results
	- tagged 6 proteins with GFP and used multicolor imaging to look at them
		- Arc15 subunit of Arp2/3
		- activators of Arp2/3: Pan1p, Abp1p, Laz17p
			- Abp and Laz are yeast WASP
		- Sla1p, adaptor for endocytic internalization
- Cortical patch turnover and motility
	- smaller than resolution limit of scope at the time
	- Patch lifetimes are lower for Abp1p and Arc15
	- proteins localize to patch and they have different colors so they can measure colocalization
	- patches move a bit around where they begin and then start really going
	- patches move from cortex to cell center
		- endocytosis
- I'm tired and did not take great notes
- actin patches with various things on them do endocytosis
