	- 1
		- use snells law with a bit of an offset to get the depth as a component of the vector. Will appear to be deeper than it is
	- 2
		- I think this one is the fish has a cone angle greater than 180 degrees? Because the dark would be the pond right
			- but wouldn't that be not actually darkness
			- nope it's not the pond
		- how do you compute the cone angle, couldn't it be anything greater than 180]
		- oh it's asking for the cone angle of the light opening, that one I understand
		- $\arcsin(\theta_c) = \frac{1}{n_w}$
	- 3
		- This one seems pretty straightforward
	- 4
		- this is also just using the lens equations directly
	- 5
		- a) matrix multiplication of $\begin{pmatrix} 1 & d \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ \frac{n_1-n_2}{Rn_2} & \frac{n_1}{n_2}\end{pmatrix}$
		- b and c I think is using the lens equations directly again
	- 6
		- This seems a bit harder
	- 7
		- figure out how to get ABCD matrix from magnification?
		- This must be possible
