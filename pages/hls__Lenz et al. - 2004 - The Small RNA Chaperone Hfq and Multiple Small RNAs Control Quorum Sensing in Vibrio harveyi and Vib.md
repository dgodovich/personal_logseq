- Knowing this suggested two possible methods by which Hfq could repress quorum sensing-controlled gene expression. First, Hfq could directly act on the mRNA encoding each of the known target genes of the quorum-sensing regulons. Second, Hfq could act on the mRNAs encoding LuxR in V. harveyi and HapR in V. choler
