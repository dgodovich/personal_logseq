- [[Abstract]]
	- Asymmetric localization of proteins plays a key role in many cellular processes, including cell polarity and cell fate determination. Using DNA microarray analysis, we identified a plasma membrane protein-encoding mRNA (IST2) that is transported to the bud tip by an actomyosin-based process. mRNA localization created a higher concentration of IST2 protein in the bud compared with that of the mother cell, and this asymmetry was maintained by a septin-mediated membrane diffusion barrier at the mother-bud neck. These results indicate that yeast creates distinct plasma membrane compartments, as has been described in neurons and epithelial cells.
