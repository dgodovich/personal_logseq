- [[Abstract]]
	- Asymmetric localization of proteins plays a key role in many cellular processes, including cell polarity and cell fate determination. Using DNA microarray analysis, we identified a plasma membrane protein-encoding mRNA (IST2) that is transported to the bud tip by an actomyosin-based process. mRNA localization created a higher concentration of IST2 protein in the bud compared with that of the mother cell, and this asymmetry was maintained by a septin-mediated membrane diffusion barrier at the mother-bud neck. These results indicate that yeast creates distinct plasma membrane compartments, as has been described in neurons and epithelial cells.

- Use cytoskeleton dependent localization of cytoplasmic mRNA
- Ash1p is a transcription factor that accumulates in the daughter cell nucleus
	- this is done by actomyosin acting on the mRNA
	- She1p (Myo4p), She2p, She3p needed for this transport
- They do an immunoprecipitation screen to look for other interaction partners of the She family
- Find IST2 as a hit mRNA that's localized to the bud
	- this one is always there though (throughout cell cycle)
- ((68d4b1ee-7844-4ebc-a9cd-88206dc1a3f2))
	- The logseq ref is missing the \Delta, deletion means that you need each of those for targeting
	- Actin regulatory protein mutations can cause mislocalization
- They use GFP to track where Ist2p goes
	- find that it is asymmetrically distributed between mother and bud in an actomyosin dependent manner
	- Also note that fluorescence is strongly diminished around the neck between the cells
	- ((68d4b2ec-b947-42fe-b0be-fdc7b316b784))
		- Can see that the boundary between the bud and the mother has no GFP
- Use FRAP to see mobility of GFP in the membrane
	- this shows that GFP is capable of membrane diffusion
	- So what's blocking it from going through the neck?
	- Must be some kind of diffusion barrier
- Temperature sensitive septin mutant used to probe if that is the barrier
	- High temp incubation makes them lose localization and diffuse through the membrane
