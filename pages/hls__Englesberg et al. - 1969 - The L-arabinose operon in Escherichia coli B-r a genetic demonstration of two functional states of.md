- it has been shown that deletions1-3 and nonsense mutations5 of the C gene lead to the productioM of a pleiotropic-negative phenotype (C-) which is recessive (cis and trans) to both the wild-type (C+) and constitutive (Cc) alleles of that gene

- constitutive L-arabinose isomerase levels (see legend, Fig. 2) of most of the former and the basal level of the latter were significantly higher than those found for the corresponding F- haploid strains
