- [[Abstract]]
	- The generation and maintenance of subcellular organization in bacteria is critical for many cell processes and properties, including growth, structural integrity and, in pathogens, virulence. Here, we investigate the mechanisms by which the virulence protein IcsA (VirG) is distributed on the bacterial surface to promote efficient transmission of the bacterium Shigella flexneri from one host cell to another. The outer membrane protein IcsA recruits host factors that result in actin filament nucleation and, when concentrated at one bacterial pole, promote unidirectional actin-based motility of the pathogen. We show here that the focused polar gradient of IcsA is generated by its delivery exclusively to one pole followed by lateral diffusion through the outer membrane. The resulting gradient can be modified by altering the composition of the outer membrane either genetically or pharmacologically. The gradient can be reshaped further by the action of the protease IcsP (SopA), whose activity we show to be near uniform on the bacterial surface. Further, we report polar delivery of IcsA in Escherichia coli and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, suggesting that the mechanism for polar delivery of some outer membrane proteins is conserved across species and that the virulence function of IcsA capitalizes on a more global mechanism for subcellular organization.

- Introduction
	- Shigella nucleates host actin filaments to form a comet tail and then pushes into neighboring cells
	- IcsA is necessary and sufficient for actin nucleation and motility
		- expressed in a unipolar fashion
		- C terminus forms \beta barrel that anchors in outer membrane
		- functional N terminus is exposed on the surface
	- IcsP is a protease specific for IcsA
		- kicks off the N terminus into the environment
		- without this protease IcsA is more broadly distributed
	- Hypothesis
		- IcsA is delivered to one pole and then spreads out from there
		- IcsP protease activity maintains gradient
		- Predictions from this
			- steady-state distribution should be determined by lateral diffusion and polar secretion
			- IcsP should sharpen the curve in a predictable manner
- ((68d49b66-f5a1-4370-a5af-fbf4afda9940))
	- should fit exponential decay
		- and it does
		- with R >= .9
	- \lambda = 0.52 \mu\m decay constant
		- distance at which fluorescence is 1/e of the original
	- ((68d4988e-4a2e-4ebe-a4da-e01ebe1973b5))
		- right figure compares fluorescence intensity of the IcsA vs a general membrane marker to show that it's not something to do with the shape of the bacteria
	- there's some bipolar bacteria but most aren't and those that are have one much stronger
		- this could be because of targeting to the future daughter cell
- Table 1 notes
	- MBG264 is E. coli strain that expresses IcsA
	- BS520 is Shigella strain that has altered membrane fluidity (more fluid)
		- chlorpromazine decreases membrane fluidity (pharmacological rescue)
	- YPIIIpIB71 is Y. pseudotuberculosis, gram negative pathogen
		- pHS3199 plasmid expresses IcsA
		- pHS3199 + picsP1 expresses both IcsA and IcsP
- ((68d49b52-e002-48d5-9b5f-f449a7b7ae41))P
	- E. coli expressing IcsA doesn't have the protease counterpart
	- it doesn't look quite as concentrated, but it's still polar
	- In this case it's actually bipolar with exponential decay along membrane
		- but over a longer distance and not in as many bacteria
	- These guys also have puncta
	- But a lot of that is due to cell division
		- stationary phase bacteria have a higher proportion of unipolar distribution
			- these also have an even shallower slope though
		- Figure 3 shows this
- ((68d49d30-e36d-4c09-9449-ac659964910d))
	- ((68d49d3d-53fb-4b02-9830-76a9c5495c76))
	- BS520 is Shigella strain that has altered membrane fluidity (more fluid)
	- increasing fluidity you still get exponential decay, but it's wayyy further out
	- rescue with drug that decreases fluidity
		- restores wt distribution including decay constant
- ((68d49e92-ab43-4c59-bc8d-d3a7a50c2212))
	- Gram negative expressing just IcsA has a unipolar exponential gradient
	- Adding IcsP has a reduction in the fraction of bacteria that have exponential gradient
		- But this does reduce the decay constant by a lot (makes it steeper gradient)
- ((68d49e9b-5b04-47dc-b5a6-7d1ecfaf6dc2))
	- set up a steady state IcsA concentration at the membrane equation
		- ((68d49fe2-1ecd-41a2-bdfa-f841734bc1b7))
	- C''(x)/C(x) does not make sense to me
		- second derivative of concentration with respect to x?
		- Why would it be that? first kinda makes sense but that's not what they put
			- diffusion is a second order process so i guess?
			- but they've been doing every thing in linear space until now
	- mostly this is a uniform distribution, which tells them that IcsP is also uniform
		- I'm not super clear on how they measure this either
		- IF? somehow
	- IcsP probably goes to the same pole as IcsA and then also diffuses
- ((68d49eab-8dfa-4382-b86c-bbd49fe4ca20))
	- They don't talk about how it gets to the pole, only that it does
	- Unclear if this is something specific to this protein or a general thing
		- ((68d4a51c-4620-4f19-936f-a47d1e363dc1))
		- seems to be general
