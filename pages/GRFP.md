	- NSF prioritizes research aligned with the budget statement, which makes sense
		- Unfortunately this doesn't involve life science unless I can think of a way to connect it to climate change which seems tenuous at best
		- [here's the actual presidential budget that outlines the points (page 129-130)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/budget_fy2025.pdf)
		- One potential angle is through the CHIPS and Science Act which broadly allocates money for semiconductor manufacturing and biotech along with that
			- So maybe something about method development? but that sounds hard
