- [Description](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/grfp-nsf-graduate-research-fellowship-program/nsf25-547/solicitation)
	- Applicants must submit the following information through the GRFP Application Module: Personal Information; Education, Work and Other Experience; Official Transcript PDFs; Proposed Field of Study; Proposed Graduate Study and Graduate School Information; the names and email addresses of at least three reference letter writers (reference letters will be provided separately by these writers); Personal, Relevant Background, and Future Goals Statement PDF; and Graduate Research Plan Statement PDF.
	- Cited references must include the titles of the journal or publication (abbreviations accepted)
	- Images may be included and do not modify the page limits.
	- Format
		- 8.5x11 page, maximum 11pt font
			- Arial or Courier New or Palatino Linotype can be used at 10
		- Descriptive alternative text must be provided for all images, graphs, and charts, including sufficient color contrast for text and graphics, and must be submitted in a machine readable/accessible electronic format (e.g., HTML)
		- PDF format
		- Separate sections for "Intellectual Merit" and "Broader Impacts," under individual headings and separated by a line break must be included in both the Personal and Research Plan statements. DO NOT include other terms in the individual headings, combine these two sections into one section, or combine them with any other section
		- Personal and Research Plan statements must have line breaks between sections. Applications that do not have line breaks between sections will be returned without review
		- Personal, Relevant Background, and Future Goals statement is 3 pages
		- Graduate Research Plan statement is 2 pages
	- But it will also tell you if your submission is not compliant, which is kinda nice
	- The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge
	- Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes
	- In accordance with these requirements, proposed projects involving use of any vertebrate animal for research or education must be approved by the submitting organization's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) before an award can be made
		- hmmmm this might complicate using mouse models
		- I wonder if Danelle has experience with this, people from her lab must have gotten GRFP
			- check the board maybe
	-
	- NSF prioritizes research aligned with the budget statement, which makes sense
		- Unfortunately this doesn't involve life science unless I can think of a way to connect it to climate change which seems tenuous at best
		- [here's the actual presidential budget that outlines the points (page 129-130)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/budget_fy2025.pdf)
		- One potential angle is through the CHIPS and Science Act which broadly allocates money for semiconductor manufacturing and biotech along with that
			- So maybe something about method development? but that sounds hard
- Workshop Notes
	- [[GRFP/Broader Impacts Workshop]]
	- Notes from AJ led workshop
		- Personal statement is more important because it's 3 pages
			- want to introduce as an interesting person in the beginning (strong hook)
			- Future directions are important
			- overall arc
			- For this I think I should combine things from my grad school SoP and personal statements to get the CV story arc and also the strong hook
				- I guess I can use the princeton essay? They're all basically the same though
		- Research plan is good practice, but it's less important for the GRFP
			- main goal is fundamental science advancement, not health relevance
		- Aims
			- Overall strategy, methodology, should be well reasoned
				- Figure is super helpful here!
