- c1 is both an activator and a repressor of transcription
	- represses P_L and P_R but activates P_RM (immunity region promoter?)
		- P_rm is for c1
	- repressed genes must be active for lytic growth
	- activated genes include c1, auto-activation
	- this is what stabilizes lysogeny
- ((68e34721-db2f-49f8-8bd4-837c9bb2d09e))
	- N terminus domain of c1 is what does the binding to DNA at the operon loci
	- this is the lysogen state - 2 of the 3 switches are activated with c1
	- the lytic state is the other state that Tom keeps showing in the slides, where only the first position is bound by cro
- They think the repressor contacts rna pol
- Binding at O_r1 is primarily to stabilize the binding at Or2
	- O_r2 is the important one for lysogeny
	- This is where there's the N terminus contact with RNA pol and activation of P_rm
- Given this information, they look for a mutant that can repress but not activate
- ((68e34866-9cb3-4f36-8acc-5003ca0a6925))
	- \lambda112 has functional immunity region from phage 21 and a fusion of lacZ onto c1
	- c1 26 is a nonsense mutation in c1
	- They have two plasmids with c1 under control of the lac promoter
		- one has O_r1 (pKB252), one does not (pKB270)
	- did mutagenesis
