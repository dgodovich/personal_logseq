- Infection after surgery is a problem, so use sterile technique
- It's not actually sterile, it's just aseptic
- Use a sterile field and precautions to prevent infection
- Survival vs non-survival surgery
	- Survival is also major vs minor
	- Major is anything that penetrates and exposes a body cavity, or has extensive tissue dissection
	- Minor causes little or no physical impairment
- Locations for conducting surgery
	- Dedicated space is a space that reserved for a specific period of time for surgery
		- procedure room or surgery suite
		- no other uses at the same time as surgery
		- should be clean, not cluttered, large enough, have separations
		- Disinfect with quaternary ammonium or phenolics or alcohols
	- Designated facility is a surgical suite specifically designated for surgery
		- not required but better
	- Physically separated functions to further reduce contamination
		- Animal preparation area
			- administering anesthetic and prepping animal for surgery
			- can include shaving, disinfection
		- surgeon prep area
		- surgery area
			- anesthesia machines
			- sterilizer for reusing instruments
		- post operative recovery area
			- observation until ambulatory again
	- Sterile barrier must be replaced between animals if multiple
	- circulating water heating pad is the best heating solution
		- heating temp of ~102F is ideal to not overheat
	- Bunch of stuff about instruments that's all pretty self explanatory, I know surgical instruments
		- needles should never be held by hand, same for scalpels
	- Notes about sterilization and autoclaving that I also already know
		- 121C for 15 minutes is sufficient
		- hot bead sterilizers are an option but only sterilize by contact
			- handles are not sterilized, nor are inside of containers
		- after chemical sterilization, instruments should be rinsed with sterile water or saline to avoid tissue damage
		- high level disinfection is submerging in a liquid chemical to mostly kill everything, can use Cidex OPA or peracetic acid
- You clip, not shave, for surgery. Or use Nair
- reglove for each animal
- Anethesia - toe pinch
- ophthalmic ointment to prevent eyes drying
- If you are working alone, you must prepare the animals for surgery before preparing yourself
	- because if you don't you have to leave the sterile field
- sutured wound heals from side to side and not from end to end
