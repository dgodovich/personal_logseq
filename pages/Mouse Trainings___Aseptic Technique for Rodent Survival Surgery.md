- Infection after surgery is a problem, so use sterile technique
- It's not actually sterile, it's just aseptic
- Use a sterile field and precautions to prevent infection
- Survival vs non-survival surgery
	- Survival is also major vs minor
	- Major is anything that penetrates and exposes a body cavity, or has extensive tissue dissection
	- Minor causes little or no physical impairment
- Locations for conducting surgery
	- Dedicated space is a space that reserved for a specific period of time for surgery
		- procedure room or surgery suite
		- no other uses at the same time as surgery
		- should be clean, not cluttered, large enough, have separations
		- Disinfect with quaternary ammonium or phenolics or alcohols
	- Designated facility is a surgical suite specifically designated for surgery
		- not required but better
	- Physically separated functions to further reduce contamination
		- Animal preparation
