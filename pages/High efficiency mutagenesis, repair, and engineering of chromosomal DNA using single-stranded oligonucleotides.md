- [[Abstract]]
	- Homologous DNA recombination is a fundamental, regenerative process
	   within living organisms. However, in most organisms, homologous
	   recombination is a rare event, requiring a complex set of reactions and
	   extensive homology. We demonstrate in this paper that Beta protein of
	   phage Î» generates recombinants in chromosomal DNA by using synthetic
	   single-stranded DNAs (ssDNA) as short as 30 bases long. This ssDNA
	   recombination can be used to mutagenize or repair the chromosome with
	   efficiencies that generate up to 6% recombinants among treated cells.
	   Mechanistically, it appears that Beta protein, a Rad52-like protein,
	   binds and anneals the ssDNA donor to a complementary single-strand near
	   the DNA replication fork to generate the recombinant. This type of
	   homologous recombination with ssDNA provides new avenues for studying
	   and modifying genomes ranging from bacterial pathogens to eukaryotes.
	   Beta protein and ssDNA may prove generally applicable for repairing DNA
	   in many organisms.
