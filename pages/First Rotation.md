- [[Jared Toettcher]]
- Starts [[Sep 8th, 2025]] through November something
- Figuring out the project
	- 3 possibilities
		- Continuation of work in Harrison's preprint
			- [[PyCLM: programming-free, closed-loop microscopy for real-time measurement, segmentation, and optogenetic stimulation]]
			- This is kinda awesome
			- Automated microscope control for coordinating cell movement
			- Loads of questions you can ask with this system / technique
				- If you stimulate the cells to move into a wound site, does that accelerate healing?
					- They mention that mouse epidermis healing has other things going on and RTK waves can't explain the speed, but maybe pushing the cells in would help to get started?
					- Conversely, would you be able to hold the cells back? RTK wave going the opposite direction away from a wound - does that stop/delay healing?
				- Works for developmental questions too
					- Can you force a gastruloid to organize?
					- Can you force LR patterning to switch?
					- Neural crest?
		- BindCraft binder prediction and following testing of a new optogenetic protein
			- [[One-shot design of functional protein binders with BindCraft]]
			- This is interesting but I think not what I want to be focusing on
		- Stem cell direction
			- Symmetry breaking in gastruloids relating to RTKs
			- [[Recording morphogen signals reveals mechanisms underlying gastruloid symmetry breaking]]
			- Could be cool
