	- [MCF10A](logseq://graph/personal_logseq?block-id=68c83ab3-3e3d-4519-ad31-52cbba7c00d0)
		- Triple transgenic
			- OptoEGFR, Fusion red nuclear, ERK-KTR
			- Fusion red is stupid bright
				- Almost problematically bright lol
		- Human breast tissue immortalized cell line
		- Frozen by Jared
			- He's interested in seeing what their density patterns look like
			- When he was imaging them / plating on fibronectin for that, he said that he noticed variability in cell densities
				- Regions clustered high density, low density outgrowths
			- Beena has been using a separately engineered cell line and doesn't see that - more consistent cell densities across the well
			- Is this something intrinsic to the cell line that Jared was working with? Is it a protocol difference?
			  background-color:: yellow
- Questions
	- (1) how does the *width *of the traveling wave stimulation pattern affect cell movement? (in other words, how macroscopic can we go with our stimulation patterns)?
		- change bar width, this seems pretty straightforward
	- (2) how different are overall migration speeds when you locally illuminate the front of every cell versus use a macroscopic traveling wave? (how much do you lose by ignoring the granularity of single cells)
		- Unclear if this is to be done with illumination of the bottom half of every cell in the frame or if it's a moving bar of single cell illumination
		- [[draws/2025-09-23-14-44-09.excalidraw]]
		-
	- (3) and of course, can you direct cells down the gradient of density to smooth it out?
	- Flow cells down a density gradient
	- Simple questions
		- Do you sterile filter the BSA?
			- No
		- Is there a fibronectin aliquot that I should use?
			- I assume that's what the PBS that Beena set aside is for? No need to wash any plates at any time?
				- Yep I will make a fibronectin solution with that guy and then keep in +4
				- Can use PBS to wash plates or fibronectin coating solution but it doesn't seem to be critical
				- Media has pen strep in it to kill some things, and it's generally not a super sterile environment anyway
- Figuring out the project
  collapsed:: true
	- I didn't take notes during the conversation but here's some thoughts after the fact
	- Gastruloid project is pretty interesting
		- The general direction for this is going towards symmetry breaking and what causes cell sorting
			- McNamara paper showed that Wnt high cells at 90-96 hr of gastruloid formation are critical for organization into the A-P axis
				- [[Recording morphogen signals reveals mechanisms underlying gastruloid symmetry breaking]]
			- But there's still open questions about Erk signaling - Wnt and Erk are cotemporary but unclear if one induces the other or if one is necessary for the other
			- If you dissociate Wnt high cells from the novel gastruloid and reconstitute, they still form A-P sorted gastruloids
			- Does this happen if you have Erk high cells?
		- This is likely to be driven by FGF
			- This is the same thing as in the mouse embryo (Woon's project), which isn't very suprising
		- I'm not huge on gastruloids because of the replication between papers and the difficulty in moving towards in vivo
			- Jared very specifically doesn't want to work in vivo (no mouse colony, big pain)
			- I think this project would be alright but it's not terribly exciting
	- Continuation of Harrison paper
		- There's a few things that happened here
		- There was a preprint from a different lab with a different closed loop microscopy system
			- Jared and Harrison put this paper out earlier than they wanted to because of that, they wanted to not miss out on a wave of this tech
			- This means that it made it into more of a tech paper than a biology paper, and there's still a lot of biology left to do
		- Some interesting things to be done with topographical maps
			- Use migration to move cells towards density reduction - smooth out topological gradient of cells
			- Can also use an equivalent thing as in Harrison's vortex module to move the cells in the direction vector of lower density (gradient descent)
				- Compare this to a global organizer, see if there's any difference
				- There probably is a difference, but if the global one has a substantial improvement that's good enough
		- In essence, this is moving cells around using light, which has the potential for therapeutic applications
			- Deepika in Danelle's lab is doing very similar things - maybe talk to her at some point?
				- I might still want to rotate in Danelle's lab
	- 3 possibilities
		- Continuation of work in Harrison's preprint
			- Ok we're doing this epic
			- [[PyCLM: programming-free, closed-loop microscopy for real-time measurement, segmentation, and optogenetic stimulation]]
			- This is kinda awesome
			- Automated microscope control for coordinating cell movement
			- Loads of questions you can ask with this system / technique
				- If you stimulate the cells to move into a wound site, does that accelerate healing?
					- They mention that mouse epidermis healing has other things going on and RTK waves can't explain the speed, but maybe pushing the cells in would help to get started?
					- Conversely, would you be able to hold the cells back? RTK wave going the opposite direction away from a wound - does that stop/delay healing?
				- Works for developmental questions too
					- Can you force a gastruloid to organize?
					- Can you force LR patterning to switch?
					- Neural crest?
		- BindCraft binder prediction and following testing of a new optogenetic protein
			- [[One-shot design of functional protein binders with BindCraft]]
			- This is interesting but I think not what I want to be focusing on
		- Stem cell direction
			- Symmetry breaking in gastruloids relating to RTKs
			- [[Recording morphogen signals reveals mechanisms underlying gastruloid symmetry breaking]]
			- Could be cool, I didn't get to read this paper so don't know much about this direction
			- Talk to Yang? Or lets just see what Jared says
