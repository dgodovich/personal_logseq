- [[Jared Toettcher]]
- Starts [[Sep 8th, 2025]] through November something
- Figuring out the project
	- 3 possibilities
		- Continuation of work in Harrison's preprint
			- [[PyCLM: programming-free, closed-loop microscopy for real-time measurement, segmentation, and optogenetic stimulation]]
			- This is kinda awesome
		- BindCraft binder prediction and following testing of a new optogenetic protein
			- [[One-shot design of functional protein binders with BindCraft]]
			- This is interesting but I think not what I want to be focusing on
		- Stem cell direction
			- Symmetry breaking in gastruloids relating to RTKs
			- [[Recording morphogen signals reveals mechanisms underlying gastruloid symmetry breaking]]
			- Could be cool
