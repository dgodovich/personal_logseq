- Starts [[Sep 8th, 2025]] through November something
- Figuring out the project
	- I didn't take notes during the conversation but here's some thoughts after the fact
	- Gastruloid project is pretty interesting
		- The general direction for this is going towards symmetry breaking and what causes cell sorting
			- McNamara paper showed that Wnt high cells at 90-96 hr of gastruloid formation are critical for organization into the A-P axis
				- [[Recording morphogen signals reveals mechanisms underlying gastruloid symmetry breaking]]
			- But there's still open questions about Erk signaling - Wnt and Erk are cotemporary but unclear if one induces the other or if one is necessary for the other
			- If you dissociate Wnt high cells from the novel gastruloid and reconstitute, they still form A-P sorted gastruloids
			- Does this happen if you have Erk high cells?
		- This is likely to be driven by FGF
			- This is the same thing as in the mouse embryo (Woon's project), which isn't very suprising
		- I'm not huge on gastruloids because of the replication between papers and the difficulty in moving towards in vivo
			- Jared very specifically doesn't want to work in vivo (no mouse colony, big pain)
			- I think this project would be alright but it's not terribly exciting
	- Continuation of Harrison paper
		- There's a few things that happened here
		- There was a preprint from a different lab with a different closed loop microscopy system
			- Jared and Harrison put this paper out earlier than they wanted to because of that, they wanted to not miss out on a wave of this tech
			-
	- 3 possibilities
		- Continuation of work in Harrison's preprint
			- Ok we're doing this epic
			- [[PyCLM: programming-free, closed-loop microscopy for real-time measurement, segmentation, and optogenetic stimulation]]
			- This is kinda awesome
			- Automated microscope control for coordinating cell movement
			- Loads of questions you can ask with this system / technique
				- If you stimulate the cells to move into a wound site, does that accelerate healing?
					- They mention that mouse epidermis healing has other things going on and RTK waves can't explain the speed, but maybe pushing the cells in would help to get started?
					- Conversely, would you be able to hold the cells back? RTK wave going the opposite direction away from a wound - does that stop/delay healing?
				- Works for developmental questions too
					- Can you force a gastruloid to organize?
					- Can you force LR patterning to switch?
					- Neural crest?
		- BindCraft binder prediction and following testing of a new optogenetic protein
			- [[One-shot design of functional protein binders with BindCraft]]
			- This is interesting but I think not what I want to be focusing on
		- Stem cell direction
			- Symmetry breaking in gastruloids relating to RTKs
			- [[Recording morphogen signals reveals mechanisms underlying gastruloid symmetry breaking]]
			- Could be cool, I didn't get to read this paper so don't know much about this direction
			- Talk to Yang? Or lets just see what Jared says
