- Notes
- Induction of reverse mutations by base analogs 2-aminopurine (AP) and 5-bromo-deoxyuridine (BD)
- T4 mutants induced by these base analogs in the forward direction and cane be induced to revert
	- But proflavine induced and spontaneous mutants can't revert by the analogs
		- Only revert spontaneously
- rII phenotype
	- lack function necessary for phage growth in bacteria K, form r-plaques on bacteria B
	- I think bacteria K is E.coli K12
