- Notes
- Induction of reverse mutations by base analogs 2-aminopurine (AP) and 5-bromo-deoxyuridine (BD)
- T4 mutants induced by these base analogs in the forward direction and cane be induced to revert
	- But proflavine induced and spontaneous mutants can't revert by the analogs
		- Only revert spontaneously
- rII phenotype
	- lack function necessary for phage growth in bacteria K, form r-plaques on bacteria B
	- I think bacteria K is E.coli K12
- T4 phage is lytic only
	- So mutants occur during the replication of the phage? During packaging and replication? Can't be incorporated into the bacterial genome
- Reversion Rates in Liquid Medium
	- rII revertants can be detected selectively by plating rII phages on bacteria K (E.coli K12)
		- Most cases plaques are wt (some exceptions)
			- double  mutants?
		- Basically your phage shouldn't be able to grow on K12, so if it does then you know that it's a revertant
	- Quantitative measurement you should use a small number of starting phage
		- This means that you have a small chance of introducing a revertant from the beginning? I think?
			- And if there is one then you'll detect it because you'll have a huge number of them
		- You want it to be rare
			- Because mutations don't happen all that often
	- So if you culture w/ and w/o the mutagen (base analogs) and compare amount of revertants then you can see how much of an effect it has
		- Reversion index is ratio of revertant to visible phages
		- Assay visible phages by growth on B
			- permissive condition, get total phage number

		- Spontaneous mutations (i.e. not caused by mutagenesis) have a modest reversion index with AP or BD treatment, but not that high
			- I think it's bc they're not point mutations
		- Treatment with one mutagen allows reversion by treatment with the other?
			- What could this mean
			- So BU is a T analog that allows binding with D - causing a point mutation?
				- BU can bind to A or G
			- AP acts like G so can pair with C
				- AP can bind to T or C
			- Yeah idk that means that they give the same mutations? so not sure why they're opposite
		- They think the increased value is because of selective pressure on phages
		- spontaneous reversion for treated phages is quite low
			- Not clear to me why this is the case
	- Spot test
		- plated mutagenesis to find revertants
		- 10x more K than B, but still a good amount of B to grow phages and for them to mutate
		- AP and BD at edges of plate encourage mutagenesis
			- edges of diffusion zone of analogs has plaque formation
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1757453459103_0.png)
			- \# of mutants that can be induced to revert with the conditions shown
			- Same result: spontaneous can't revert with mutagenesis, analogs can revert analog mutations
	- Figure 1 shows that spontaneous mutations are scattered throughout the genome equally but AP or BU mutations are not
		- Concentrated at certain locations
		- because that's where the bases are?
- "No mutant could be induced to revert which cannot revert spontaneously"
- Further examination of revertants
	- 4 possibilities for plaque formation on K12
		- back mutation - back to wt
		- partial reversion - different that restores function
		- suppressor - somewhere else
			- This isn't real according to them
		- Leakiness - not fully incapable of growth
	- ![image.png](../assets/image_1757454137799_0.png)
		- This is very hard to understand
	- No suppressor has ever been observed
		- They backcrossed to wt phage and those had no problems
			- i.e. the children are normal so the mutant must have been fixed
- Come back to discussion later
  background-color:: yellow
- Method
  collapsed:: true
	- 400 phages added to 20mL growth media with 10^8 bacteria (B so the phage can grow)
	- Incubated for 24h
	- Plate out onto lawn of B and K do determine phage titer and revertant frequency
	- AP induction
		- Bacteria B-97 in H medium + 30ug/mL adenine, 500 ug/mL AP
		- H medium
			- Synthetic + 20 ug/mL histidine + 0.25 ug/mL thiamine
	- BD induction
		- Bacteria B-97 grown in F10 + 50 ug/mL BD
		- F10 medium
			- 1L H medium plus 20mg glycine & methionine; 10mg leucine, valine, serine, adenine sulfate, guanine sulfate, uracil; 0.2mg Ca pantothenate, pyridoxine; 10 ug Vitamin B12
		- Thymine is added and aminopterin for some reason
