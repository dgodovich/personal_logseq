- [[Abstract]]
	- A modular misexpression system was used to carry out systematic gain-of-function genetic screens in Drosophila. The system is based on inducible expression of genes tagged by insertion of a P-element vector carrying a GAL4regulated promoter oriented to transcribe ﬂanking genomic sequences. To identify genes involved in eye and wing development, the 2300 independent lines were screened for dominant phenotypes. Among many novel genes, the screen identiﬁed known genes, including hedgehog and decapentaplegic, implicated in these processes. A genetic interaction screen for suppressors of a cell migration defect in a hypomorphic slow border cells mutant identiﬁed known genes with likely roles in tyrosine kinase signaling and control of actin cytoskeleton, among many novel genes. These studies demonstrate the ability of the modular misexpression system to identify developmentally important genes and suggest that it will be generally useful for genetic interaction screens.
