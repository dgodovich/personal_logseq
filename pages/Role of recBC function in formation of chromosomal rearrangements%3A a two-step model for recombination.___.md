- [[Abstract]]
	- The role of recBC functions has been tested for threetypes ofchromosomal recombination events: (1) recombination between direct repeats to generate a deletion, (2) recombination between a small circular fragment and thechromosome, and (3) recombination between inversely oriented repeats to form an inversion. Deletion formation by recombination between direct repeats, which does not require afully reciprocal exchange, is independent of recBC function. Circle integration and inversion formation are both stimulated by the recBC function; these events require full reciprocality. The results suggest that half-reciprocal exchanges can occur without recBC, but recBC functions greatly stimulate completion of a fully reciprocal exchange. We propose that chromosomal recombination is a two-step process,and recBC functions are primarily required for thesecond step.

- recBC gene product is ExoV nuclease
	- in vitro data shows that double stranded ends are the major substrate
- use circular constructs to see what happens
	- These don't have double stranded ends to begin with
	- If double stranded ends are a requirement, then RecBC dependence of recombination would suggest that double stranded ends are intermediates at some point
- They test for
	- recombination between direct repeats (deletion formation)
	- chromosomal integration of a circular by product
	- Inversion rearrangement
- Materials and Methods
	- MudJ insertions into recB and recC?
	- Hol- is histidinol
		- They're using His-and Hol- to compare parts of the his operon function
	- 43hr of incubation chosen? what the hell
	- Transposon at *ara* in TT13870
		- this can excise *his* material?
		- I guess the element between the IS elements has part of the his operon?
		- This section seems important
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1758250141177_0.png)
			- Ok they did not say this in the text lmao
			- inverse order seems important
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1758249948630_0.png)
		- ok so it seems like the element between the Tn10 elements carries part of the his operon and they select for recombination and transposition into the his operon by selecting for His+
			- So you're getting some pretty tiny fraction of hits here?
			- Ah and it has to be a circle to recombine back into the operon because otherwise it won't have enough homology
				- At least according to them
	- Recombination of the transposon gives a His+ recombinant with a reversion of the element in ara
		- They can detect this because..... I'm not sure
		- Something about transduction repair would be low frequency?
		- Oh because it's kanamycin resistant
