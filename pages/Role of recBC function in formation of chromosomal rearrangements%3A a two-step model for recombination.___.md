- [[Abstract]]
	- The role of recBC functions has been tested for threetypes ofchromosomal recombination events: (1) recombination between direct repeats to generate a deletion, (2) recombination between a small circular fragment and thechromosome, and (3) recombination between inversely oriented repeats to form an inversion. Deletion formation by recombination between direct repeats, which does not require afully reciprocal exchange, is independent of recBC function. Circle integration and inversion formation are both stimulated by the recBC function; these events require full reciprocality. The results suggest that half-reciprocal exchanges can occur without recBC, but recBC functions greatly stimulate completion of a fully reciprocal exchange. We propose that chromosomal recombination is a two-step process,and recBC functions are primarily required for thesecond step.
