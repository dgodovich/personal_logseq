- [[Abstract]]
	- Proteins in bacteria often deploy to particular places within the cell, but the cues for localization are frequently mysterious. We found that the peripheral membrane protein SpoVM (VM) recognizes a geometric cue when localizing to a particular membrane during sporulation in Bacillus subtilis. Sporulation involves an inner cell maturing into a spore and an outer cell nurturing the developing spore. VM is produced in the outer cell, where it embeds in the membrane that surrounds the inner cell but not in the cytoplasmic membrane of the outer cell. We found that VM localized by discriminating between the positive curvature of the membrane surrounding the inner cell and the negative curvature of the cytoplasmic membrane. Membrane curvature could be a general cue for protein localization in bacteria.

- This is interesting
- How do bacterial membrane proteins understand surface curvature?
- SpoVM localizes to a specific area of the membrane
- Spore formation process
	- Cell divides asymmetrically to create mother and forespore compartments
	- Mother engulfs the forespore
		- creates bilayer membrane on forespore
	- Protein coat deposited on the outer forespore membrane
		- this depends on VM
- VM
	- amphipathic \alpha helix
	- inserts into membrane with long axis parallel to membrane
	- hydrophobic face inside the bilayer
	- Localizes to forespore membrane even before engulfment is completed
		- Proline 9 necessary for this
		- P9A mutation results in promiscuous localization
	- How does it know where to go?
	- ((68d2145c-6833-462e-aa2c-83890a45dfdf))
- Subtilis mutants that can't finish sporulation have indiscriminate VM localization
	- Except sometimes this mutant bulges
		- and then it localizes specifically to the bulge
	- ((68d21483-9d64-48d0-ba61-84c9adac87ee))
- Test curvature hypothesis in a heterologous host with other curved membranes
	- E. Coli mutant missing MreB that forms internal vesicles
	- VM localizes to the surface of vesicles
		- P9A mutant is still non specific
	- It's not anything specific in subtilis
		- works in both e. coli and yeast
	- geometric cue
- It cares about the size of the curvature too
	- artificial lipid vesicles VM localizes to the smallest one every time
	- P9A mutant goes wherever
	- adsorption to membranes is sensitive to curvature and P
