- Bruh you can just feed worms RNA
-
-
- 1) What distinguishes forward from reverse genetics - which is this?
	- I think this is reverse because they RNAi specific genes to get a phenotype
- 2) What advantages does RNAi have over mutagenesis?
	- way faster to find the genes that you're looking for because you start from those
	- titrate loss of function
	- reversible function, you have wild type animals
- 3) What are the disadvantages of using RNAi?
	- need to have the genome sequence
	- off target effects
		- designing targeted probes can be hard since you use ~30 bp
	- gene duplications may make it difficult / functional redundance
	- only loss of function
	- regulatory information is hidden because it's single allele
		- mutagenesis can hit multiple alleles and you get a spectrum of information
- 4) How is the RNAi being delivered, when are the worms are being treated and when are they being screened (i.e. at what developmental stages/which generation)?
	- feeding L4 RNAi, continued into progeny
- 5) What difficulties did they encounter in the screen and how did they get around them?
- 6) Was the screen successful (what is the measure of success)? Do you think they learned
  anything interesting or new from the screen?
