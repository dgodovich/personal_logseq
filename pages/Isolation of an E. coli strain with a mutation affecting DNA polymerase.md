- Notes below
- Introduction
	- They testing seveal thousand colonies of mutagenized E. coli
	- Found mutant with 1% normal polymerase
	- Increased sensitivity to ultraviolet light
	- Kornberg discovered DNA polymerase
		- Proves that a small part of a cell's DNA is need to code for a mechanism to duplicate the whole
		- This enzyme is actually used for repair, not duplication
	- Theorized that repair and duplication have different polymerases
		- Based on affinity for thymine substitute 5-bromouracil
	- They want to find the actual enzyme that does DNA replication
		- Found a mutant that has a defect in polymerase
- The Selective Procedure
	- Assay polymerase in clones of a mutagenized stock until they found what they wanted
		- Rather than trying to guess what symptoms it would have, just do exhaustive search
	- Conditional lethal mutation is possible (based on temperature?)
		- Grew clones at 25 or 30 degrees, assayed at 37/45 degrees
		- But this didn't matter anyway as it turned out
- Extraction of Polymerase
	- Use a detergent Brij-58 to do something??
	- Do a DNA extraction to get DNA in the pellet and polymerase (plus other proteins) in the supernatant
	- Assay polymerase function by adding calf thymus DNA and DNA components
		- Importantly they used H_3 labelled tyrosine
		- Radiolabelled for detection of activity?
	- Any method of lysis that liberates fragmented DNA with create sites for attachment of polymerase
		- Will not give a true picture of location of polymerase in vivo
	- Brij gives you cells that can't incorporate dNTPs for some reason
		- Does not dissociate polymerase from DNA (bc you can assay with Brij present)
		- Most polymerase does not associate with DNA and is free in the cell
