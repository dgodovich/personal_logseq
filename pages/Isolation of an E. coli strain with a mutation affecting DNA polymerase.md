- Notes below
- Introduction
	- They testing seveal thousand colonies of mutagenized E. coli
	- Found mutant with 1% normal polymerase
	- Increased sensitivity to ultraviolet light
	- Kornberg discovered DNA polymerase
		- Proves that a small part of a cell's DNA is need to code for a mechanism to duplicate the whole
		- This enzyme is actually used for repair, not duplication
	- Theorized that repair and duplication have different polymerases
		- Based on affinity for thymine substitute 5-bromouracil
	- They want to find the actual enzyme that does DNA replication
		- Found a mutant that has a defect in polymerase
- The Selective Procedure
